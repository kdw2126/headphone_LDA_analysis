                   'connector exiting the top rear.  The nozzle has almost no '
                   'rake so provides for fairly deep insertion but due to '
                   'materials, isolation is only average.  A single vent sits '
                   'over the dynamic driver offset slightly from the middle of '
                   'the driver to avoid the curvature of the nozzle.   The '
                   'face-plate has a lip around the the outer edge so it sits '
                   'partially in the plastics shell as seen in the pictures '
                   'below.  This is the opposite of most of the KZ made models '
                   'where the face-plate overlaps the shell. Seams are smooth, '
                   'machining of the face-plate is well done with no obvious '
                   'toolmarks and fit between parts is very good.   The C12 is '
                   'on the larger side, but sits fairly comfortably in ear and '
                   'does not approach the size of the Zs10 that was '
                   "uncomfortable for many. If  the Zs5 series didn't bother "
                   "you size wise, chances are the C12 won't either. "
                   'Internals: The C12, like its ZSX cousin, is a 6 driver per '
                   'side design using a single 10 mm dynamic driver to provide '
                   'low end grunt, four DWEK midrange balanced armatures to '
                   'bring the mids to life, and a single 30095 balanced '
                   'armature to give the highs a voice.    Nominal impedance '
                   'is listed as 24Ω with a sensitivity of 112dB/mW and is '
                   'nearly identical to the ZSX but unlike the A10 clones, '
                   'this one differs a bit in signature.    I did find the C12 '
                   'easy enough to drive from a smart-phone or tablet and '
                   'while quality benefits from better sources, an external '
                   'amp is really not necessary to run the C12 to its full '
                   'ability. Cable: CCA has stuck with using the brown KZ '
                   'cable thus far and the C12 retains it again.  I am not a '
                   'big fan as I find the splitter oddly placed which is then '
                   'compounded by the lack of a chin slider.  Luckily the '
                   'hooded-bi-pin style connector is now popular enough that '
                   'many replacement options are available.  I promptly '
                   'replaced the stock cable with an upgrade cable from '
                   'Nicehck designed for the Nx7 and it worked perfectly and '
                   'remedied some of the issues I have with the stock cable. '
                   'Sound: The C12 is tip sensitive and I found does its best '
                   'with narrow bore silicones.  I settled on a pair of '
                   'Spin-fits for my listening and testing. Bass: The C12 has '
                   'good sub-bass when called upon with roll-off only becoming '
                   'evident below 40Hz.  Mid-bass has slightly less emphasis '
                   'than the sub-bass but still provides good thump.  Mid-bass '
                   'attack is faster than decay and gives the bass a bit of '
                   'extra fullness.   Bass is not slow or muddy, and no big '
                   'bloom is present, but it does feel slightly thickened at '
                   'times.   The attack gives the kick drum a nice snap on the '
                   'initial hit and keeps the bass from sounding less '
                   'defined.   Overall, not a ton of detail in the bass, but a '
                   "nice thick presentation that won't leave the user wanting "
                   'for bass quantity. Mids: There is some mid-bass bleed that '
                   "colors the lower mids, but it isn't overstated and brings "
                   'some warmth to what might otherwise be a bit dry '
                   'presentation by the balanced armatures.   Mids start '
                   'moving forward about as quickly as they transition from '
                   'the bass while both male and female vocals have good '
                   'weight, female vocals are a bit more forward in the mix '
                   'and a bit more lively.  Mids have better detail than '
                   'expected at this price point and are surprisingly clean.  '
                   'String timbre is good but can be a slightly sharp-edged at '
                   'times as the boosted lower treble comes into play and '
                   'viola is typically a bit more natural than violin as a '
                   'result.   Guitar has good growl on electrics and fairly '
                   'natural sound for acoustics. Treble: CCA has been doing a '
                   'better job thus far with the 30095 in the treble than '
                   'their KZ counterparts and with this model,  although its '
                   'twin has improved, the CCA remains a step ahead with a '
                   'more linear and better tuned treble.   Treble stays very '
                   'level from 2kHz all the way through 6kHz before dropping '
                   'back.  This gives the presence region a bit of extra '
                   'energy without becoming harsh or fatiguing.   A later push '
                   'back up at 10kHz brings back some top end air and sparkle '
                   'without jumping way out in front of the rest of the '
                   'signature.   Treble detail is only average, but clarity is '
                   'good and extension is better than expected.  overall, this '
                   'may be the best tuned treble out of a KZ family member to '
                   'date. Soundstage / Imaging: This is where the C12 comes '
                   'back down to earth. Soundstage is only average for class '
                   'with considerably more width than depth and only minimal '
                   'height.   Instrument separation is above average and '
                   'seating the orchestra shows good positioning for the most '
                   'part although the stage feels a bit shallow and '
                   'instruments are pushed closer together front to back than '
                   'side to side in the presentation.  Imaging is fairly good '
                   'with spatial cues being well represented and movement '
                   'around the stage being fairly well articulated.  The '
                   'problem I have with the imaging is at times when a '
                   'vocalist moves in the mix it winds up behind the guitar or '
                   'strings as the C12 pushes that upper-mid more forward in '
                   'the mix.  This is particularly true of lower range vocals '
                   'in the baritone range. Comparison: Well after the recent '
                   'releases where we have seen multiple brandings on the same '
                   "iem, I thought we'd do a quick compare between the ZSX and "
                   'the C12 since they are at the very least fraternal '
                   'twins.   Both share the same drivers, cable, and nozzle '
                   'but differ in shell and faceplate and possibly '
                   'cross-over.    I find the ZSX to be slightly more '
                   'comfortable with its more ergonomic shape, but I find the '
                   'signature more pleasant on the C12 with a bit more treble '
                   'linearity.  No doubt these two share more in common than '
                   'not, but they are not the same exact iem as we saw in the '
                   'previous C10 round of releases. Thoughts / Conclusion: '
                   'Clear Concept Audio continues to be an interesting '
                   'offshoot of the KZ family.  At one point, I had thought '
                   'CCA was going to be the flagship branding, then they '
                   'released some lower end models, at another point I thought '
                   'maybe they were a way to increase brand awareness by '
                   'creating a different persona in the market, then they '
                   'released two or three that were sonic duplicates of their '
                   'KZ counterparts.   Due to a communication miscue, I have '
                   'two ZSX samples, and the C12 on my desk right now and my '
                   'first thought in looking at the pile was "oh, goodie!  '
                   'another set of KZ triplets".  I am happy to report that is '
                   'not the case as both while certainly similar do have their '
                   'own voicing as well as their own design aesthetic.   For '
                   'me, the better of the lot is the CCA C12.  If I were '
                   "buying one or the other, I'll take the slightly more bulky "
                   'shell with the better treble over the ZSX with its more '
                   'ergonomic shape and slightly spiky treble rendering.',

                   '“sparkle”, and brought vocals somewhat forward in the mix. '
                   'Enya’s “Echoes in Rain” from her “Dark Sky Island” album '
                   'was a good example of this with lyrics clearly enunciated '
                   'even allowing for the very powerful bass-driven '
                   'accompaniment, and the character of Enya’s voice nicely '
                   'preserved. MIDI guitarist Mark Dwane has revisited his '
                   'first album “Monuments of Mars” in his latest opus, '
                   '“Martian Apparitions”. Well-known for his audiophile '
                   'standard recordings, this certainly applied here. In '
                   '“Galaxis Chaos" the crisp, clean lead synth line stood out '
                   'clearly from the powerful driving accompaniment, resulting '
                   'in a very exciting presentation. Classical music also '
                   'fared well, with Bax’s “Tintagel” showing an orchestra in '
                   'full flight. Swirling string parts combined with snarling '
                   'brass interjections in the dramatic introduction, to be '
                   'followed by a beautifully expressed main theme in the '
                   'strings set against a rocking woodwind accompaniment. '
                   'Treble The treble had good extension and timbre. '
                   'Separation was above average, enabling subtle details to '
                   'emerge. In the Minuet from John Ireland’s “Downland Suite” '
                   'by the English String Orchestra, the lead melody was '
                   'nicely detailed with the differentiation of various '
                   'instruments clearly defined. The lively accompaniment '
                   'showed excellent timing and the counterpoint was easy to '
                   'follow. Deuter’s “Petite Fleur” from the album “Land of '
                   'Enchantment” features a lead melody resembling a music '
                   'box. The attractive theme shone out clearly above the '
                   'guitar and synthesised background and displayed a '
                   'well-reproduced ambience. The high synth tones towards the '
                   'conclusion were clear and pure in tone. The drums and '
                   'percussion in Linton Kwesi Johnson’s “Man Free” cut '
                   'through the production wonderfully. Sly Dunbar’s drumming '
                   'here was exemplary, dovetailing beautifully with Robbie '
                   'Shakespeare’s bass, with the high hats in the instrumental '
                   'break superbly clean and incisive. Soundstage The C12 '
                   'possessed an extensive panoramic soundstage, excellent '
                   'layering and first-class separation. Jean-Michel Jarre’s '
                   '“First Rendezvous” impressed greatly in this regard with '
                   'the initial deep synthesiser drone echoing menacingly and '
                   'the various string synth layers well-defined. Stereo '
                   'imaging on this track was superb with electronic effects '
                   'moving around the stage in entertaining fashion and the '
                   'dynamic conclusion to the piece powerfully portrayed. The '
                   'beautiful flute solo in Stuart Mitchell’s “Mausoleum at '
                   'Halicarnassus” from his “Seven Wonders Suite” floated '
                   'delicately above the orchestral accompaniment. Breath '
                   'sounds could be heard clearly and the ambience of the '
                   'recording venue added to the atmosphere, especially at the '
                   'end of the track where the natural decay of the timpani '
                   'could be heard in the distance. Dave Brubeck’s “Take '
                   'Five”took you to the sudio in authentic style with the '
                   'performers laid out in a natural acoustic. Saxophone solo '
                   'and bass in the centre, drums on the left and piano on the '
                   'right. Joe Morello’s amazing drum solo came over superbly '
                   'with a wonderful metallic sound to the cymbals and the '
                   'timbre of the various drums nicely differentiated. '
                   'Conclusion CCA seem to raise the bar with each successive '
                   'release. After the impressively-detailed C16 and the '
                   'accurate “warts and all” sound of the A10, the C12 adds a '
                   'powerful bass foundation to the detail and precision of '
                   'the earlier models. Boasting an impressive soundstage with '
                   'excellent layering and separation, it has a largely '
                   'neutral signature with an attractive sparkle in the upper '
                   'register, and I feel it is the most accomplished IEM from '
                   'CCA so far. Its closest competitor is the new KZ ZSX which '
                   'shares the same components housed in a different shell and '
                   'configuration. The ZSX has a deeper sub-bass presentation, '
                   'a warmer overall tone and an immense soundstage, but does '
                   'not display the same precision or detail retrieval as the '
                   'C12. It makes for a more relaxing listen, whereas the C12 '
                   'majors on detail and has a more incisive transient nature. '
                   'Both are excellent IEMs and the choice between them will '
                   'be largely a preference of sound signature. N.B. The '
                   'comparison between the ZSX and C12 was carried out using '
                   'the stock cable and tips on both models to obtain an '
                   'accurate appraisal as possible. This pruduct was provided '

                   'the drivers. Step 2: Gluing the strain relieve and BA in '
                   'the housing. The kit provided glue to fix all the items in '
                   'the rubber housing. It is some sort of clear glue which is '
                   'very viscous and somewhat annoying to glue. It can be '
                   'clean up using wet tissue but leaves some residue behind '
                   'which needed to be clean after the glue completely dries. '
                   'Step 3: Fitting the retainer clips. The kit provides a '
                   'pair of stainless steel retaining clips. It can be '
                   'expanded and enclose the wire portion snugly. Both side is '

                   'nozzles with metal mesh. The housing with rubber seal. The '
                   'angled part is faced towards the rear. The kit provided 6 '
                   'types of foams and materials for filtering. It ranges from '
                   'unfiltered, low to high density foams. Unfortunately in my '
                   'case, all the filters disintegrated due to aging(I presume '
                   'it was stored for some time). I run the IEM without filter '
                   'for this test(Would probably play around with the filters '
                   'in the future). The instructions also encourage the user '
                   'to try with different materials to find the preference '
                   'sound. The nozzle and housing assembly. The nozzle is '
                   'screwed on and can be easily removed. Step 5: Gluing the '

                   'and light weight, it should fit straight right into your '
                   'ear. It is very comfort and I have no problem wearing it '
                   'for a long time. With the provided tips, it isolates quite '

                   'source for testing are my smartphone and my Sony NW-A45 '
                   'Walkman. Both running Heaven II unamped and without any '
                   'EQ. The eartip is the stock wide bore medium provided '
                   'along the package. Bass : The bass is adequate, but lacks '
                   'some extension to the deep down. It is punchy, accurate '
                   'and not overshadow any aspect. But a little more oomph and '
                   'quantity would really appreciated. But being a single BA '
                   'configuration, the bass is accurate and the speed is '
                   'appreciated during complex instruments and songs. Mid : '
                   'This is where the strong suit of the Heaven II. The mids '
                   'are lush and natural, but not in a clinical style or '
                   'signature. The male and female vocals sound so desirable '
                   'and really articulates. In live recordings, they sounded '
                   'natural and smooth. A slice of Heaven in your ears. High : '
                   'For the treble, it does not extend as much as the mids and '
                   'rolls-off a little. This is good which I can listen for '
                   'quite some time without fatiguing highs. But it still have '
                   'some sibilance on certain track, YMMV. In this case, I '
                   'think the high, like the bass, is taking a back seat in '
                   'this IEM. Soundstage : The soundstage might not be crazy '
                   'wide, nor the best details, but it has good imaging, and '
                   'good amount of airiness on top. It is intimate and '
                   'relaxing. = Value/Price = \u200b I bought this unit from a '
                   'fellow member in an audio marketplace section in my local '
                   'internet forum. It is priced around US$60 at the time I '
                   'bought it. For this price, it provided the pleasure of '
                   'DIY, building your own IEM as well having your own '
                   'signature in sound which made available by the removable '
                   'nozzle feature. I really appreciate the process of going '
                   'through the assembly, giving some patience and rewarded by '
                   'the listening session with a slice of Heaven(Pun '

                   "for it's price range and it's mid-range performance. The "
                   'materials from construction wise and sound quality are '
                   'impeccable. It really separates itself from clinic, '
                   'analytic sound; instead it provides a relaxing, intimate '
                   'listening session for you to relax and unwind. In the end, '
                   'this is my first full-length review of an IEM in this '

                   'listen to. PACKAGING AND ACCESSORIES: The TRN V90 comes in '
                   'a small white tray with a black and white slipcover. The '
                   'selected mic and color options are indicated on the right '

                   'and TRN’s contact information are listed on the back. The '
                   'V90 comes with a detachable .75mm 2-pin cable, three pairs '
                   'of dark grey silicone eartips (S, M, L), a user manual, a '
                   'QC pass chit, and a warranty card. The V90 does not '
                   'include a carry bag or case. BUILD QUALITY / DESIGN: The '
                   'V90 has a three-part, all-metal housing with a triangular '
                   'cross-section. The longest edge of the triangle faces '
                   'forward. There are no sharp edges anywhere on the housing. '
                   'The inner face of the housing has a gentle crescent shape, '
                   'with a small protrusion on the top corner. The nozzle is '
                   'swept down and forward from the bottom corner. There are '
                   'two rectangular vents on the bottom corner of the outer '
                   'faceplate, and one circular vent on the inner face of the '
                   'housing. The nozzles have a small lip for securing '
                   'eartips. The V90 has mild-to-moderate driver flex. The V90 '
                   'has the same venting issue as the Simgot EM1, where if the '
                   'inner vent is covered during insertion, the sound produced '
                   'by the IEM is muffled and must be gently tugged away from '
                   'the ear to restore proper clearance. The V90 comes with a '
                   'braided 4-core cable with angled 2-pin connectors and a '
                   'straight 3.5mm jack. The cable has little-to-no '
                   'microphonics. The 2-pin connectors have indented markings '
                   'to indicate left and right. The cable has pre-formed '
                   'ear-guides without memory wire. The TRN logo is printed on '
                   'the 3.5mm jack housing. There is no chin-adjustment '
                   'choker. The cable is not tangle-prone. There is '
                   'strain-relief above the 3.5mm jack but none at the '
                   'Y-split. COMFORT / FIT / ISOLATION: The TRN V90 is '
                   'intended to be worn cable-up only. The V90 has a deeper '
                   'than average insertion depth and I was able to get a good '
                   'seal using the stock eartips. I found the V90 very '
                   'comfortable to wear for long periods. Isolation is above '
                   'average, and I have not received any complaints about '
                   'sound leakage (in comparison to the TRN H1, for which I '
                   'have received complaints at equivalent volumes). SOUND: '
                   'The TRN V90 has a bassy V-shaped tuning. The V90 does not '
                   'have a mid-bass hump, instead emphasizing sub-bass over '
                   'mid-bass. Sub-bass extension is striking. The bass region '
                   'as a whole is elevated above the lower midrange. There is '
                   'abundant rumble and powerful slam. The bass has average '
                   'speed and articulation and can become confused and '
                   'indistinct during complicated, bass-heavy passages. This '
                   'is most evident in heavy varieties of electronic dance '
                   'music. The bass is highly textured but can be boomy and '
                   'borderline overwhelming. Although the lower midrange is '
                   'recessed compared to the mid-bass, male vocals retain good '
                   'intelligibility and have plenty of warmth and body. Female '
                   'vocals are a bit further forward than male vocals. The '
                   'overall timbre is realistic. There is enough presence to '
                   'give distorted electric guitars bite without being '
                   'fatiguing. The treble is energetic but surprisingly '
                   'smooth. Transients are crisp without being unrealistically '
                   'quick. There is a healthy amount of sparkle and air. '
                   'Overall resolution and detail retrieval are middling. '
                   'Soundstage, imaging and instrument separation are average '
                   'for a budget multi-BA hybrid. MEASUREMENTS: My '
                   'measurements were conducted with a Dayton iMM-6 microphone '
                   'using a vinyl tubing coupler and a calibrated USB sound '
                   'interface. The measurements use a compensation file '
                   'derived from relating my raw measurements with Crinacle’s '
                   'published measurements. The measurements are presented '
                   'with 1/24th smoothing. The magnitude of the valley at 7k '
                   'is a coupler artifact. There is a resonant peak around 8k. '
                   'Measurements above 10k are not reliable. AMPLIFICATION '
                   'REQUIREMENTS AND SOURCE PAIRING: The TRN V90 can be driven '
                   'to comfortable listening volumes with a smartphone or '
                   'dongle. There is noticeable hiss with some sources. '
                   'COMPARISONS: TRN V90 vs Blon BL-03 The Blon BL-03 uses a '
                   'single carbon nanotube dynamic driver. It has a more '
                   'neutral sound signature, with a much more restrained bass '
                   'presentation and a less forward upper midrange and treble '
                   'response. The BL-03 has better bass definition and '
                   'articulation. It is much easier to get a good seal using '
                   'stock tips with the V90. Because I need to use double '
                   'flange tips with the BL-03, the V90 is more comfortable. '
                   'The BL-03 has worse driver flex. The V90 is easier to '
                   'drive but is much more prone to hiss. The V90 does not '
                   'come with a bag or carry case, while the BL-03 comes with '
                   'a Blon-branded pouch. KZ ZSX vs TRN V90 The KZ ZSX is a '
                   'six-driver (5BA+1DD) hybrid IEM. The two IEMs have very '
                   'similar tunings, but the V90 is bassier than the ZSX and '
                   'has a more elevated lower treble response. Despite this, '
                   'the V90’s treble is smoother-sounding than the ZSX’s. The '
                   'V90 has more defined, better-articulated bass than the '
                   'ZSX. The V90’s upper midrange is a touch more forward than '
                   'the ZSX but has no issues with sibilance. The V90 has '
                   'better clarity and detail retrieval. The V90 has better '
                   'imaging. The V90 has slightly worse driver flex. The V90 '
                   'has less hiss. The V90 is more comfortable. CLOSING WORDS: '
                   'The TRN V90 is a great-sounding budget hybrid IEM with an '
                   'annoying usability concern which prevents me from '
                   'recommending it without qualification. If the venting '
                   'issue sounds manageable to you, it replaces the CCA-C10 as '

                   'for my honest review and opinion.[/note] Introduction '
                   'BQEYZ is an in-ear monitor (IEM) manufacturer from China. '
                   'Unlike many manufacturers, BQEYZ is involved at every '
                   'point of their products’ development: from design to '
                   'development and even to production. "Engaging the service '
                   'of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can potentially '
                   'save a manufacturer a lot of cost. However, BQEYZ strives '
                   'to keep it all in-house." Triple hybrid IEMs, like BQEYZ’s '
                   'Spring 1, utilize three different types of drivers to '
                   'cover the sound spectrum. The strengths of some types of '
                   'driver cover the weaknesses of the other types. This can '
                   'improve the overall performance of an IEM compared to '
                   'conventional non-hybrid configurations. Elle Zhou, the '
                   'person in-charge of BQEYZ, notified me in June 2019 of the '
                   'Spring 1 release. I am fortunate to be selected to review '
                   'this new flagship from BQEYZ. In this review, I will bring '
                   'you through the Spring 1’s amazing journey! Unboxing The '
                   'packaging of BQEYZ Spring 1 is classy. The outer sleeve is '
                   'black with a photo of IEMs, the model name, and BQEYZ’s '
                   'logo. Removing the outer sleeve, you’re greeted by a hard '
                   'black box with a silver logo printed on the top corner. '
                   'Opening the hard box, Spring 1 officially makes its first '
                   'appearance to the happy recipient. The metallic faceplate '
                   'caught my attention immediately. There is an accessory box '
                   'in the lower part of the inner box. Opening the accessory '
                   'box, users find a black semi-hard case. The following '
                   'accessories are included in the semi-hard case: 6 pairs of '
                   'silicone ear tips 3 pairs for “Atmosphere”: - with smaller '

                   'hard to present a unique IEM to customers, internally and '
                   'externally. BQEYZ uses an aluminium shell when crafting '

                   'mechanism, the shell produced is smooth and free of sharp '
                   'edges which would otherwise cause discomfort when worn. '
                   'The nozzle is made of aluminium, too. I have seen a lot of '
                   'broken plastic nozzles when users change ear tips, so this '
                   'is an important selling point for me. The nozzle is often '
                   'a fragile section of an IEM and I am glad BQEYZ paid '
                   'special attention to it. On top of the shell, there is a '
                   'slightly-recessed 2-pin port. I am glad that BQEYZ is '
                   'using a conventional 2-pin connector for this model. It '
                   'makes cable rolling easy. The cable provided in the box is '
                   'an eight core 0.78mm 2-pin 3.5mm unbalanced SPC cable. '
                   'There is a heat-shrink ear guide without metal wire in it. '
                   'I like this type of ear guide because those with a metal '
                   'wire will create noise when walking, with the metal wire '
                   'clicking against spectacles. Moving down the cable, the '
                   'Y-splitter is grey in color and includes a neck slider '

                   'color scheme as the Y-splitter and there is a strain '
                   'relief to provide additional durability. Fit and Isolation '
                   'I spent a lot of time here to find the ear tips that give '
                   'me the best isolation. The provided ear tips are too short '
                   'to sit well in my long and deep ear canals. Eventually, I '
                   'found the SpinFit CP145 , which is provided in FiiO FH7 '
                   'packaging and which fits me better than the original ear '
                   'tips. With the correct ear tips, the isolation is '
                   'moderate. I seldom use this commuting because the noise '
                   'from the surrounding environment leaks in. This is '
                   'distracting. However, fit and isolation is subjective. Ear '
                   'tip rolling can improve the isolation. I am still on my '
                   'way to find the best ear tips. There are three vents on '
                   'the inner side of the shell to mitigate driver flex. BQEYZ '
                   'is careful in designing the vent. It is good practice to '
                   'implement the vent on the inner side because this '
                   'minimizes the external noise once you are able to find a '
                   'good fit. Driver flex: when the driver bends under the '
                   'pressure of air against it. This usually occurs when '
                   'inserting the IEM into the ear. The air in the shell '
                   'creates pressure, which bends the driver. Pairing For this '
                   'review, I paired the Spring 1 with the Lotoo Paw 5000 mkii '
                   'digital audio player (DAP). I used SpinFit CP145 size L '
                   'ear tips for this review. I cannot comment on the '
                   'differences between BQEYZ’s provided ear tips because they '
                   'did not fit me well. Sound "Exuberant is the most '
                   'appropriate word to describe the sound signature of Spring '
                   '1." This is a relatively neutral IEM. When I first '
                   'listened to it, it reminded me of Empire Ears’s Empire '
                   'Studio Reference (ESR). There is a lot of energy in this '
                   'IEM from all the regions of the frequency spectrum. It is '
                   'fun but not fatiguing to listen to. The soundstage is deep '
                   'and wide. I would call it an oval shape stage because is '
                   'extends more in the Y-axis than it does in the X-axis. '
                   'Although the impedance is relatively high compared to '
                   'other IEMs on the market, it can be properly driven with '
                   'my Lotoo Paw 5000 mkii. It could be hard for a smartphone '
                   'to unleash Spring 1’s potential. So, I would encourage '
                   'users to use a dedicated amplifier or DAP to obtain the '
                   'best result. Lows The bass extension is decent. I do not '
                   'experience any sub-bass roll-off. A dynamic driver is used '
                   'here to produce the low frequency. Due to the response '
                   'speed of the 13mm dynamic driver, the bass decay is '
                   'slightly prolonged; this injects some warmth into the '
                   'overall sound signature. This is especially pronounced '
                   'when listening to jazz. I really like how saxophones in '
                   'jazz recordings sound on Spring 1 - warm with full body. '
                   'On the other hand, due to the slower response in the low '
                   'frequencies, there is some bleeding of the mid-bass into '
                   'the mids region. This slight bleeding could affect the '
                   'mids performance a little but the correct layering during '
                   'tuning minimizes the effect. BQEYZ has actually managed to '
                   'make the transition from lows to mids smooth. Mids A BA '
                   'driver covers the mid frequency region and the mids take '
                   'centre stage (no pun intended) during playback. I would '
                   'not call this a mid-centric IEM, but it does have a '
                   'slightly forward midrange. This could be a selling point '
                   'to those users who listen to pop songs like me. Male and '
                   'female vocals are handled well by Spring 1. When Olivia '
                   'Ong starts singing in Fly Me to the Moon (from the album A '
                   'Girl Meets Bossanova ), she owns the whole stage. Sweet, '
                   'airy, and spacious female vocals melt my heart '
                   'immediately. For male vocals, the energy from the lows '
                   'gives the overall sound a full and organic body. Andy Lau '
                   'sounds emotional and full of soul in When I Met You (from '
                   'the album Blue Heart) with Spring 1. Highs "Spring 1’s '
                   'secret weapon dominates the war of IEMs in the USD$200 '
                   'price range!" The Spring 1 uses a piezoelectric driver for '
                   'the treble region. Soaring highs are a good adjective for '
                   'Spring 1’s performance in the high frequencies. It is '
                   'airy, spacious, and very well-extended. I call this the '
                   'secret weapon because within this price range, it is rare '
                   'to find an IEM with such amazing performance in the highs. '
                   'The air in the highs improves the overall fidelity of '
                   'Spring 1. The sparkling highs also balance the warmth of '
                   'the lows, making this IEM well-balanced overall. "Are the '
                   'soaring highs bright or fatiguing? Well, although I have a '
                   'good tolerance for high frequencies, I find the highs in '
                   'Spring 1 to be as comfortable as a gentle tickle on my ear '
                   'drums." Comparisons BQEYZ Spring 1 vs NiceHCK NX7 This is '
                   'an attractive comparison and was a frequent request by '
                   'netizens in the comments on my unboxing post. A quick '
                   'introduction, NiceHCK NX7 is a triple hybrid IEM with 7 '
                   'drivers: 2 dynamic drivers, 4 BA, and a single '
                   'piezoelectric driver. I have always been more of a '
                   'believer in Campfire Audio’s ideology: less is more. '
                   'Driver count does not always tell us which is better. NX7 '
                   'is a cold and dark sounding IEM. The lows response is '
                   'touch and go. The extension in Spring 1 is much broader '
                   'than NX7. This makes Spring 1 more enjoyable to listen to. '
                   'Soundstage wise both of them are equally wide, but Spring '
                   '1 is deeper due to the bass extension. Personally, I would '
                   'vote for Spring 1 without any doubts. BQEYZ Spring 1 vs '
                   'Simgot EK3 Both of these models are triple driver '
                   'configured. For those who wish to know more on EK3, you '

                   'different groups of audiophiles. Both of them have a '
                   'neutral sound signature, but there are some differences. '
                   'EK3 is darker compared to Spring 1. I would describe '
                   'Spring 1 as an untamed horse galloping through a field, '
                   'while EK3 is a small rabbit hopping around a meadow. '
                   'Spring 1 has more energy and excitement when producing '
                   'sound while EK3 is on the shy side. The extensions in lows '
                   'and highs is a sure win for Spring 1 due to the limitation '
                   'of the full BA configuration in EK3. Conclusion The Spring '

                   'an outer zinc alloy faceplate, an inner transparent '
                   'plastic shell, and a metal nozzle that appears brass or '

                   'The inner shell houses the drivers, connector, and nozzle '
                   'and most of the components are easily visible.   There is '
                   'a single vent over the dynamic driver.  The DB3 fits '

                   'is fairly thin.   Nozzles exit with a slight forward rake '
                   'and insertion is fairly shallow. Internals: The DB3 is a 3 '
                   'driver hybrid consisting of a coaxial dual dynamic driver '
                   'with a graphene diaphragm and a titanium dome material '
                   'along with a custom tuned 30095 balanced armature driver '

                   '16Ω with a sensitivity of 106 dB/mW.   I found the DB3 to '
                   'be easy to drive from a phone tablet and while quality '

                   "rumble when called upon, but doesn't attempt to turn every "
                   'song into a bass show like some do.  Mid-bass falls from '
                   'the sub-bass peak to the mids and provides ample thump '
                   'without obstructing other elements behind it.   With a '
                   'string of less than spectacular offerings from NiceHCK of '
                   'late, I was expecting more of the same, so this was a nice '
                   'change of pace.  Bass is lively enough to command your '
                   'attention, but not hot enough to take over the joint.  '
                   'There is slight mid-bass bleed into the lower mids that '
                   'carries a bit of warmth with it, and at times does hide a '
                   'little detail in that region. Mids: The transition between '
                   'mid-bass and mids is probably the least emphasized portion '
                   'of the signature but does still manage to have more '
                   'presence than expected and never really gave the '
                   'impression of being recessed as much as just not '
                   'particularly emphasized.  Mids do climb forward as you '
                   'move up and give both male and female vocals very good '
                   'weight and presence with female vocals being maybe 1/2 '
                   'step in front but again both are well presented.   Guitars '
                   'are well rendered with the electric having a slightly more '
                   'natural tone than its acoustic sibling.  Violins are '
                   'passable but are not the wheelhouse of the driver and do '
                   'sound a bit less fluid than high end models.  (Again its '
                   '$20, what did I expect?)   I keep coming back to the '
                   'vocals as they are something special for an iem at this '
                   'price as they always sit in front the same distance '
                   'regardless of the volume of what is going on around them.  '
                   'The quietest passage or the biggest hit, both have the '
                   'vocal staged equally.  Impressive. Treble: I think one of '
                   'the smart moves NiceHCK made with the DB3 was using a '
                   'single ba to handle the upper duties rather than trying to '
                   'pack a bunch more drivers in for a techno dog and pony '
                   'show like so many of the recent releases have become.    '
                   "Treble isn't the most even I have heard with some regions "
                   'being considerably more emphasized than others, but it '
                   'stays clean throughout and provides a bit of extra energy '
                   'that open up the top end and give the DB3 good air and '
                   'some sparkle even without getting strident or harsh in the '
                   'process.   Cymbals are slightly metallic at times, but '
                   'better than expected at this price.  Snare hits are not as '
                   'crisp as upper models, but rattle is clean and well '
                   'defined. Soundstage / Imaging: Soundstage is wider than '
                   'deep but has solid dimensions so not over-crowded and '
                   'manages some sense of height.   Instrument separation is '
                   'on par with others in its class (average).  Seating the '
                   'orchestra is fairly straight forward with no large '
                   'anomalies or oddities but the orchestra does end up being '
                   'wider and shallower than a standard seating chart.   '
                   'Layering is better than expected as the coaxial driver '
                   'does a good job handling this.  Imaging is good with '
                   'spatial cues readily recognizable and movement around the '
                   'stage easy to track.   There is some minor compression as '
                   'tracks get exceptionally complex but well within the '
                   'expected at $20. Thoughts / Conclusion: For awhile, I had '
                   'found NiceHCK to be a good value as they made several '
                   'solid models at good prices.  The Height of that was '
                   'probably the M6.  Unfortunately, since then, NiceHCK had '
                   'taken a turn and produced a string of models that were '
                   'tuned with very forward treble, or were techno dog and '

                   'DB3.The prototype was decent but not what I consider '
                   'special.  Bass was a bit too big. I can tell NiceHCK '
                   'wanted to go with a more consumer tuning on the DB3. The '
                   'mids and treble suffered from the brawny bass but today we '
                   'have a much more balanced offering. NiceHCKs final tuning '
                   'is immediately familiar to me. It is a version of their '
                   'house tuning. Unlike the NX7 which was more of an '
                   'analytical type tuning with a sound foundation of detail, '
                   'resolution and imaging.  DB3 is the phone you want when '
                   'your out and about working walking, playing or just '
                   'relaxing. Getting your bass on. When you want to hear your '
                   'favorite tune with dynamism and aplomb. Can a $20 earphone '
                   'do that? The DB3 comes in your standard NiceHCK packaging '
                   'and much like the NX7, the packaging is bare bones and '
                   'really nothing special. Phones, single ended copper cable, '
                   'pouch and 4 pairs of silicone tips. New to this particular '
                   'package is a medium sized double flange tip. So it goes '
                   'without saying your favorite aftermarket tips and cables '
                   'will come into play here perhaps more so than even the '
                   'NX7. The DB3 is the one earphone I broke my own rule. I '
                   'try not to use a cables that cost the same or more than '
                   'the phone itself. But when they cost $20. That is an easy '
                   'rule to break. I will have some tips on the right matching '
                   'cables and tips to use for the DB3 and the NX7 toward the '
                   'end of the read. Build wise they are fairly solid. Housing '
                   'is comprised of a zinc alloy shell and plastic. This is '
                   'the exact same build as many KZ, CCA, and now NiceHCK '
                   'earphones. The housing size is medium/ smallish for sheer '
                   'size so they will fit most ears with comfort. The nozzle '
                   'is fairly short but has the correct angle to fit most ears '
                   'comfortably. I have had zero issue with fit or the comfort '
                   'of the phones themselves. Average in isolation. Foam tips '
                   'helps a bit for isolation. They are used over the ear. I '
                   'like that NiceHCK is using more 2 pins on their earphones '
                   'now. I think they realized there are less problems when '
                   'using 2 pins so it makes logical sense to design newer '
                   'earphones with 2 pins. .78mm 2 pins apply on these so any '
                   'of the standard 2 pins will fit these well. The tuning has '
                   'turned for the much better on their retail version vs the '
                   'prototype. Some magical tuning has been done with these. '
                   'They are going for a musical full bodied sound here and '
                   'the one advice I gave to NiceHCK crew was if your gonna do '
                   'bass you better have some space and balance is always key '
                   'for a great sounding product. As compact as the design '
                   'here is somehow they did it. These are bassy but don’t '
                   'sound congested or too up in your face or too V in '
                   'balance. In fact the stage actually seems to have an '
                   'expansion in width and height/depth that seems to stretch '
                   'a bit beyond the shells. The stage of sound has '
                   'limitations due to the housing. Stages is somewhat similar '
                   'to the NX7. About average in width and depth but the use '
                   'of space is fantastic on the sound of the DB3. The '
                   'tonality and ability of the DB3 sounds more like a dynamic '
                   'based earphone than a BA based one which is usually not '
                   'the norm for hybrids. What this gets you is a very nice '
                   'take on the hybrid where the BA takes treble duties only '
                   'and lets the capable dynamics do vocals instrument and '
                   'that bass. Incorporating a titanium dome, Graphene and PET '
                   'diaphragms in a coaxial dual dynamic and using a single BA '
                   'for treble. Overall tone of the earphones are slightly '
                   'warm past neutral tonality due to the bass and mids taking '
                   'precedence of the sound design. Not overly warm but a '
                   'light jacket warm on a nice cool breezy Fall day warm. '
                   'They sound natural rich and musically smooth. Very dynamic '
                   'when called for and a blast to listen to due to their '
                   'ample bass end and lovely vocal performance be it male or '
                   'female vocals. The sound design has the treble enhancing '
                   'the mids and bass. For a budget offering, detail and '
                   'imaging is good. It is the dynamics of the sound that is '
                   'excellent for the price. Bass that comes alive for your '
                   'best bass heavy tracks. These are clearly made for bass '
                   'and vocal lovers. Ya that is right folks. When was the '
                   'last bassy earphone you heard that incorporates a lovely '
                   'up front vocal tuning.? Sure the bass is not reference '
                   "level bass here you wouldn't expect that for a budget "
                   'offering. It can overshadow the lower mids giving it the '
                   'slightly warmer tonality but for the most part sound is '
                   'balanced well for a bassy iem. Mid bass seem to have more '
                   'emphasis than sub bass but sub bass do not have much in '
                   'the way of roll off. These are almost borderline basshead '
                   'but where the real surprise is at is the mids and treble '
                   'having presence and don’t take much of a step back to the '
                   'bass. The overall tuning is more balanced which tends to '
                   'be more difficult the more bass heavy the design is. They '
                   'do have a V shaped Fr but more due to the emphasized mid '
                   'bass and a 7K treble peak. Mids of the DB3 has good range '
                   'and fullness much better than most budget fi earphones I '
                   'have owned in the past. The rich, smooth tonality of the '
                   'mids help balance out the sound of the DB3.  Sound '
                   'separation and space of instruments while only average in '
                   'these aspects has a non fatiguing smoothness quality to it '

                   'massage when called for the bass end of the DB3 is for '
                   'folks that thought the NX7 was a bit tame in the bass '
                   'area. These don’t hold back the punch and rumble.  Neutral '
                   'guys will not like these much but would be missing out on '
                   'some outstanding vocal performances.  These remind me a '
                   'lot of the tuning that is on the Fiio FH5. For a $20 phone '
                   'to match a phone 10X cost. That is saying something. So do '
                   'these sound good? Ya you bet. Especially pop hip hop,edm, '

                   'reason why vocals have full range and great presence for '
                   'this tuning. Treble for the most part is clean, crisp and '
                   'is represented well to balanced out the full sound on the '
                   'DB3. It does have some peaks at 4K another at 7K and the '
                   'last peak being around 15k, The peaks gives the upper mids '

                   'splashiness was heard but nothing that ruines the overall '
                   'enjoyment of the sound. Extension and definition in the '
                   'treble could be better, but for what it is, treble does a '
                   'good job of complimenting this musical take on the NiceHCK '
                   'house sound. DB3 incorporates a crossover PCB that seems '
                   'to allow this hybrid to have good cohesion to the sound. '
                   'In this section I will go into some tips cables and '
                   'sources that match up well with the DB3. DB3 being a full '

                   'do so a dedicated source and or an amp is recommended to '
                   'bring out the beast that can be the DB3. They sound fine '
                   'on a phone but sounds amazing on an amp.Neutrally tuned '
                   'sources are highly recommended as well as silver/ silver '
                   'coated copper cables to bring out a bit of extra detail '
                   'and tighten up that bass end a bit farther. For tips it '
                   'will be a matter of preference as you can enhance the bass '
                   'even more so using foams. I found that using a medium '
                   'wider bored tips like Symbio W tips reduces the bass end a '

                   'critical factor that decides if something has to be tried '
                   'or not: how do they sound? Personal preferences: I mainly '
                   'listen to EDM subgenres, from Dupstep and Future Bass to '
                   'some more genres which represent a niche in the music '
                   'market. I even like listening to vocal tracks (moreover '
                   'from female singers like Sia) and sometimes Rock tracks. I '
                   'always search for IEMs that have a little bit of emphasis '
                   'in the lower region, and can sacrifice mids with some '
                   'recession if they still sound clear and natural. I love '
                   'vivid and sparkling highs if they’re not at a headache '
                   'level. Soundstage has to be at least average with a bit of '
                   'air. V-shape signature is my favourite one. Lows : lows '
                   'are emphasized with good sub-bass response. The Shuttle '
                   'are certainly bassy but the bass has a sort of '
                   '“mainstream” style that makes it punchy but not highly '
                   'precise. In this case, bass was good out-of-the-box while '
                   'I remember I have had some distortion problems with the '
                   'Ace in the first days, which disappeared after some use. '
                   'Mids : mids are recessed but in a different way than on '
                   'the Ace. The Shuttle have recessed midrange with upper '
                   'midrange being some dBs even lower. Female voices sound a '
                   'bit off while male voices are ok. Instruments are not '
                   'highly textured but this is understandable considering the '
                   'bass bleed and the midrange recession. Highs : highs are '
                   'not fatiguing at all but details are sacrified. This is '

                   'commercial argument they use, since they recommend S8Pro '
                   'on their website for professionals and producers. We are '
                   'therefore faced with 2 interpretations of a balanced '
                   'restitution. Here are the Crinacle measurements '
                   '(uncompensated) to compare PP8 (with bass boost) and '
                   'S8Pro. Return below is done with the PP8 in this position. '
                   'Bass : The peak of the Sub Bass (20 to 60Hz) and Bass (60 '
                   'to 250Hz) is located at the junction of the two registers '
                   'whose restitution is very linear and typical of BA. Fast '
                   'and equally present on both pairs, the rendering is still '
                   'a little different. They seem a little slower on the PP8 '
                   'side due to a slightly longer "sustain". This gives a '
                   'better impact for the S8Pro, a more physical feeling. '
                   'However, some people may lack a real slam and a few subs '
                   'that are found on Dynamic Drivers (DD) like the Trinity '
                   'for example. The quantity and unbooming nature of the '
                   'basses offered here finally allow the rest of the '
                   'registers to express themselves while providing a solid '
                   'foundation for the music. Mids : The midrange is more matt '
                   'and dense on the PP8 and more open and airy on the S8Pro, '
                   'but with a very pleasant sensuality for both. The Low-Mids '
                   '(250 to 500Hz) is quite close and in the continuity of the '
                   'basses on the 2 sets. If we assume that the Mids (500 to '
                   '2000Hz) and High-Mids (2000 to 4000Hz) of the PP8 are '
                   'neutral, we obtain a Mids a little behind on the S8Pro. '
                   'Both men and women have slightly less warm voice tones. '
                   'But at the same time, the High-Mids a little ahead allows '
                   'to bring shine to these same voices and notes. The sound '
                   'of the PP8 seems fuller but less luminous in comparison. '
                   'The 4000Hz peak of the S8Pro can also be a little annoying '
                   'for some people depending on the recordings. In '
                   'comparison, Trinity Low-Mids are a litlle more recessed '
                   'and Mids are even deeper and airier. The High-Mids is more '
                   'flourishing, promoting development of harmonics and '
                   'timbres efflorescence. Highs : The treble extension is '
                   'quite similar on both in-ears. But due to the 4KHz peak of '
                   'the S8Pro which extends a little beyond that, the high '
                   'frequencies seem a little less present. They also seem a '
                   'slightly less accurate on the S8Pro, more floating. '
                   'Relaxed and pleasant on the 2 pairs, they offer a '
                   'beautiful resonance on the cymbals and allow them to have '
                   'enough space to flourish. A nice success without '
                   'brilliance. In comparison, the highs of the Trinity are '
                   'quite similar to those of the S8Pro in terms of quantity '
                   'but sound more natural, much more accurate and much more '
                   'aerated. Soundstage: With the PP8, we have a very wide but '
                   'relatively shallow sounstage, height is rather average. '
                   'With the S8Pro, we move back a few rows in the audience '
                   'but the singers are not closer to the musicians. The depth '
                   'and width therefore improves slightly, as does the height. '
                   'However, we remain below the Zeus XIV in terms of width '
                   'and the Trinity for depth and height. The Magic Square: As '
                   'a result of the above, S8Pro seem to have a little more '
                   'resolution and separation than PP8, except in the high '
                   'frequencies where PP8 take over. Definition and '
                   'transparency seem to be of the same kind on both 8 BAs. It '
                   'should be noted, however, that S8Pro are more sensitive '
                   'and dependent on recordings than PP8, which can sometimes '
                   'increase recording whisper and bring out small '
                   'imperfections. In comparison, separation and resolution '
                   'are better on Trinity, transparency and definition are a '
                   "little higher too. Final Thoughts : As always, it's all "
                   'about favorite taste. If you want a soft, matte, dense and '
                   'perfectly balanced sound, the PP8 are made for you. They '
                   'will allow you to listen to your favorite songs for hours '
                   'without fatigue by highlighting the production work. '
                   'However, some might say that they are a little boring, '
                   'flat and dull. If you want a little spice and clarity '
                   'without denaturing your songs and moving too far from a '
                   'balanced playback, the S8Pro is for you. Gamblers and '
                   'luminous, available for less than half the price of PP8, '
                   'the Fearless are a very convincing proposal. But be '
                   'careful if you have a 4KHz sensitivity and be aware that '
                   'recording quality might be an issue. Definition : '
                   '"Resolution is the ability to individualize a voice or '
                   'instrument, so it is a synonym for detouring" "Separation '

                   "If you're not very familiar with them, they have a rich "

                   'produced the first custom-fit IEM with a balanced armature '
                   'driver. In 1996, working with Jerry Harvey, they produced '

                   'have been making universal-fit IEMs for decades as well. '
                   'They claim to be the largest manufacturer of custom-fit '
                   'earpieces in the world, which is probably true, '
                   'considering they make earpieces for hearing protection and '
                   'the military in addition to just IEMs for musicians and '
                   'audiophiles. They are headquartered in Colorado. You can '
                   'read more about the company here . Today, they offer an '
                   'extensive lineup of many universal and custom IEMs. This '
                   'review is for the B50 ($699.99) , a universal-fit '
                   'five-driver balanced armature IEM. Westone designed the '
                   'B50 for "the music lover who just can’t get enough '
                   'low-end. By combining our largest low-end '
                   'balanced-armature driver, with two mid-range, and two '
                   'high-frequency drivers the B50 creates a sound that is '
                   'totally immersive, with sonic detail and clarity that has '
                   'to be heard to be believed." The B50 is the more expensive '
                   'sibling of the three-driver B30 ($449.99) . Together, '
                   "these two IEMs form Westone's new B series, which is "
                   'specifically tuned for those who enjoy a low end that is '
                   'far above neutral. The B series is an offshoot of '
                   "Westone's regular audiophile lineup, the W series . More "
                   'specifically, the B50 and B30 are each a new version of '
                   'the older W50 and W30, respectively, which appear to have '
                   'been discontinued. Westone told me that while the basic '
                   'driver packages are similar in design to the outgoing '
                   'older W50 and W30, the crossovers and acoustic couplers '
                   'have been completely redesigned. As the B50 is not '
                   'designed for serious studio work or those who want a more '
                   'neutral sound, I am not going to penalize it for this in '
                   'my review. I personally enjoy a bass-heavy signature, so '
                   'keep that in mind when reading this review. For this '
                   'review, I used my iPhone 6 as a source and music ranging '
                   'from 320kbps Spotify to lossless. I own higher end desktop '
                   'sources, but believe that IEMs should be able to be driven '
                   'well from a smartphone, as they are designed for on-the-go '
                   'use. While the B50 might sound slightly better with more '
                   'expensive equipment, I believe that at its price point '
                   'most customers will be using it with just a smartphone. As '
                   'such, they are relatively easy to drive at 35Ω, and I had '
                   'no issues using them with my iPhone. With both included '
                   'cables I usually had my iPhone set to just under halfway '
                   'for volume. As I previously mentioned, the B50 is five '
                   'balanced armature driver design with a three-way passive '
                   'crossover. Westone specifies the frequency response as 10 '
                   'Hz – 20 kHz, the sensitivity as 118 dB SPL at 1 mW and '
                   'passive noise attenuation (isolation) at 25 dB. Rounding '
                   'out the specs is a 24-month warranty, which is normal at '
                   "this price point. You can read Westone's spec sheet for "
                   'the B50 here . The best place to buy the B50, or any other '
                   "Westone IEM, is probably from Westone's own website. The "
                   'links above will take you to it. Design and Accessories – '
                   '19/20 The packaging of the B50 is elegant and nice enough '
                   'to be presented as a gift without going overboard. The '
                   'front of the large box has an enlarged picture of the B50, '
                   'with an equalizer band below it. Five of the equalizer '
                   'bands are colored orange to represent the five drivers in '
                   'each B50 earpiece. The other sides of the box have '
                   'information about Westone and the B50 itself. The top 90% '
                   'of the box comes off, revealing a pull flap. Under this is '
                   'the B50 along with the carrying case, which contains all '
                   'the other included accessories. The design of the B50 is a '
                   'bit bland, but very functional. The oval-shaped earpieces '
                   'themselves are made of a hard plastic with nozzles that '
                   'are a bit narrower than most other IEMs I have used. The '
                   'nozzles have a six-character serial number printed onto '
                   'them. A metal face plate sits on the end of the earpiece '
                   'opposite the nozzle. These faceplates can be swapped out '
                   'using an included tiny screwdriver; black comes '
                   'preinstalled but orange ones are also included. The '
                   'faceplates wrap around the earpiece, with an R or L on the '
                   'inside to indicate the channel and bold B50 text on the '
                   'outside. I initially swapped out the black for the orange '
                   'on only the right side, to make it easier to distinguish '
                   'the two channels when putting the earphones in my ears. '
                   'But I soon found the large letter on the faceplate to be '
                   'more than sufficient to tell them apart, so I switched the '
                   'left earpiece over to the orange as well. While the B50 '
                   "isn't going to win any fashion contests, I found the "
                   'orange faceplates to be more stylish and vibrant. The last '
                   'notable feature on the housings are the MMCX connectors '
                   'that allow for the cable to be changed, either between the '
                   'included 3.5mm or Bluetooth cables or a third-party '
                   "option. Westone told me that the B50's MMCX connectors are "
                   'durable enough to support frequent replacement of the '
                   'cable, say if you wanted to switch back and forth between '
                   'Bluetooth or 3.5mm several times a week for different '
                   'uses. MMCX and two-pin connectors are the two most popular '
                   'connectors for IEM cables. Personally, I prefer two-pin, '
                   'as the earpiece can rotate around on the MMCX pin, which '
                   'can make it harder to tell which channel is which when '
                   'taking them out of the case. But that is a minor issue. As '
                   'previously mentioned, the B50 includes both a 3.5mm cable '
                   "and a Bluetooth cable. The 3.5mm cable is Westone's "
                   'High-Definition Silver MMCX Audio Cable ($124.99) . This '
                   'is a premium cable and is a step above the regular cable '
                   'included with lesser earphones. According to Westone, this '
                   'cable "features four multi-strands of ultra-low resistance '
                   'pure silver-plated copper tensile wire which improves '
                   'electrical conductivity and is reinforced with a special '
                   'aramid-fiber strengthening core. This lightweight cable '
                   'also uses a smooth low-durometer outer sleeve that is '
                   'specially designed to keep cable noise to a bare minimum, '
                   'and remain soft and flexible even through the most rugged '
                   'use ... The smooth-jacketed, ultra-low resistance '
                   'High-Definition Silver Cable from Westone, improves '
                   'electrical conductivity, provides extraordinary detail and '
                   'clarity, with enhanced sound reproduction, making it the '
                   'perfect match for our entire line of universal-fit '
                   'earphones and custom-fit in-ear monitors." Each side of '
                   'the cable starts with the MMCX connector with a '
                   'translucent covering over it for strain relief. At the top '
                   'of the strain relief covering, over the connector, is a '
                   'thin colored ring to mark the channel; red for the right '
                   'and blue for the left. While important for connecting it '
                   'to the proper earpiece, I found the big lettering on the '
                   'earpiece faceplates to be much more practical for telling '
                   'the sides apart in day-to-day use. The strain reliefs give '
                   'way to transparent earguides that extend about two inches '
                   'down the cable. There is no memory wire under the '
                   'earguides, which is a shame, as I do find cables with '
                   'memory wires stay over the ear a bit better than those '
                   'without. I am taking off half a point for this lack of '
                   'memory wire, as the cable infrequently had to be adjusted '
                   'to stay over my ear when I was walking or moving my head a '
                   "lot. This wasn't a major issue, but is something that "
                   "shouldn't happen to begin with. After the earguides, each "
                   'channel has a thin braided strand of two wires that meet '
                   'at the translucent two-piece cable splitter after about a '
                   'foot. There is no in-line remote control and microphone, '
                   'which I think is acceptable since this is a premium cable '
                   'designed for the best sound quality possible, and the '
                   'included Bluetooth cable does include a remote and '
                   'microphone. The cable splitter is sturdy and features a '
                   'clear W Westone logo on it. I found the cinch of the '
                   'splitter to work well for helping the B50 stay put and '
                   'minimize cable noise. After the splitter, the two channel '
                   "cables aren't joined together, but rather continue in "
                   'separate but connected plastic coverings until they reach '
                   'the translucent 3.5mm connector. The connector is at a '
                   'right angle and is very sturdy. Unfortunately, the '
                   'right-angle connectors are very awkward to use with '
                   'headphone adapter dongles on newer smartphones, so I am '
                   'taking half a point off for this. This is either going to '
                   'be a nonissue or big deal depending on your source device. '
                   'Personally, I am not a big believer in expensive cable '
                   'upgrades like some on head-fi are. But this cable features '
                   'a nice combination of durability, high-end cabling and '
                   'stylish design that should prevent all but the most '
                   'hardcore cable enthusiasts from having to upgrade it. '
                   'While I think the asking price of $124.99 when purchased '
                   'separately is a bit steep, this is definitely a nice cable '
                   "and it's great to see it included with the B50 over "
                   "Westone's cheaper and more basic cables. The B50 also "
                   "comes with Westone's original Bluetooth Cable ($99.99) "
                   'that was released in 2016. I say original, because has '
                   'since came out with a Bluetooth V2 Cable ($149.99) . There '
                   'are a few differences between the two. The included '
                   'original cable uses the older Bluetooth 4.0 standard with '
                   'the CSR8645 chipset, supports aptX, has 8 hours of battery '
                   'life and is IPX4 rated for sweat resistance. The V2 cable '
                   'upgrades these specs to Bluetooth 5.0 with the CSR8675 '
                   'chipset, supports aptX HD 8 hours of battery life with a '
                   'removable battery pack that provides an additional four '
                   'hours in between charges and is IPX5 rated for sweat and '
                   'water resistance. Both versions of the Bluetooth cable '
                   'feature a three-button remote and microphone. '
                   'Additionally, both cables support the AAC codec in '
                   'addition to their respective versions of aptX. This is '
                   "important for iPhone owners since Apple still doesn't "
                   'support aptX. The included cable lacks the voice announcer '
                   'found in most modern Bluetooth audio products. Usually, '
                   'this announces the device name, battery level, codec being '
                   'used and volume level, and I missed having it. But this '
                   'feature was not nearly as common in 2016 when this cable '
                   "was released. The Bluetooth's cable's controls are a bit "
                   'different than most three-button remotes, but I quickly '
                   'got used to them. Instead of double and triple pressing '
                   'the middle button to switch tracks, you hold down the '
                   'volume up and down buttons for a second. Siri is activated '
                   'by double pressing the middle button instead of holding it '
                   'down. The cable recharges via micro USB, and a short cable '
                   'is included. I did not use the Bluetooth cable enough to '
                   'have to recharge it, but I have no reason to doubt '
                   "Westone's claimed battery life. The cable's battery "
                   'percentage shows up in iOS, and I received the cable at '
                   '60%. After using it for a few hours it was at 40%. You can '
                   'read more about the included Bluetooth cable in the spec '
                   'sheet and quick start guide . Each side of the Bluetooth '
                   'cable has a black covering over the MMCX connector for '
                   'strain relief. There are no colored rings for channel '
                   'identification here like in the 3.5mm cable, rather each '
                   'side has a L or R embedded into the strain relief '
                   'covering. It is definitely not the most visible way to '
                   'identify each side, but it works fine for the switching '
                   'out the cable. Any other time you can just rely on the '
                   'faceplate markings. The cable has no earguides or memory '
                   'wire in the ears. About four inches down on each side is a '
                   'battery (left side) or remote and microphone (right side). '
                   'These are each about an inch and a half long. The cable '
                   'then has a cinch that controls any excess length, which I '
                   'found there to be plenty of. There are two ways to wear '
                   'the cable: with the excess cable channeled in front of the '
                   'body or in back. I found wearing it in back to be more '
                   'comfortable and have a more secure fit, but the mic is '
                   'basically unusable in this position since it is behind the '
                   'neck. When I made calls in this position the caller had '
                   'trouble hearing me. On the other hand, when I wore it in '
                   'front, it was slightly less comfortable but callers said I '
                   'sounded crystal clear. I am not taking off any points for '
                   'this because it is an issue many similar Bluetooth '
                   'products have and when worn in front of the body the '
                   'microphone sounds great. In terms of sound quality, I '
                   'found the Bluetooth cable to be excellent. I was '
                   'pleasantly surprised considering it uses Bluetooth 4.0, '
                   'which dates back to 2010. Some may find it to be a bit '
                   'less detailed than the 3.5mm cable, but I am hesitant to '
                   'criticize it for this because I was only able to use the '
                   'AAC codec, and not the higher-resolution aptX. Regardless, '
                   'even with AAC I found the cable to sound at least 80-90% '
                   'as good as the 3.5mm cable. If your source supports aptX '
                   "it'll sound even better. The connection strength is very "
                   'good. Very occasionally, perhaps a few times every half '
                   'hour, the sound cut out for less than a second. So, the '
                   "connection isn't perfect, but it's more than usable. Just "
                   'like with the included 3.5mm cable, I think the asking '
                   'price of the Bluetooth cable when purchased separately is '
                   'a bit steep, given that it uses a dated version of '
                   'Bluetooth and lacks a voice announcer. But there are very '
                   'few other companies that I am aware of that include both a '
                   '3.5mm and Bluetooth cable in the box (Audeze comes to mind '
                   'with its latest LCD-i3). Therefore, I am very happy to see '
                   'this cable included in the box with the B50. It will '
                   'definitely be good enough for some customers, but if your '
                   'device supports aptX HD or you plan on using the B50 '
                   'exclusively with Bluetooth I would consider upgrading to '
                   'the V2 cable. The B50 includes ten pairs of tips: five are '
                   'silicon (Westone calls these Star Fit) and five are foam '
                   '(Westone calls these True-Fit). Each size tip comes in '
                   'both silicon and foam. There are two thicknesses of '
                   'shorter tips and three thicknesses of longer tips. Westone '
                   "colors the part of each tip that goes over the earpiece's "
                   'nozzle according to its length and thickness. For example, '
                   'the thickest longer tip is colored orange. The colors are '
                   "the same for each size's foam and silicon tips. This is a "
                   'great idea and should make reordering tips a lot easier, '
                   'as you just need to look for the color of the tips you '
                   'like instead of remembering what size they are. Westone '
                   'claims to have invested significant resources in '
                   'developing their tips and it shows. They are definitely '
                   "high quality. I would've liked to have seen some "
                   'double-flanged silicon tips as well, as I have liked those '
                   'on other IEMs I have tried, but I am not taking off any '
                   'points for this since the B50 includes as many, if not '
                   'more, tips than most other IEMs. The last included '
                   'accessory is the nylon hardshell case. It has a metal '
                   'Westone logo on the bottom right of the top and a sturdy '
                   'zipper around the middle. This is a pretty big case, and '
                   'it can hold the B50 and all included accessories. If you '
                   'use a separate audio player other than your phone, it '
                   'might fit in the case if you take out some of the '
                   'accessories. My iPhone 6 was just a bit too tall to fit, '
                   'and most newer smartphones are even bigger. The inside of '
                   'the case is lined with a luxurious feeling velvety '
                   'material. There is a divider on one side of the case along '
                   'with a mesh covering to hold any smaller accessories. '
                   'Overall, this is a nice case and should do a great job of '
                   'protecting the B50. Unfortunately, it is too big to be '
                   'pocketable. I usually just put it in my messenger bag in '
                   "the morning, but this didn't work if I left without taking "
                   'the messenger bag. I will probably complement the included '
                   'case with a smaller one for when I just want to take the '
                   'B50 and need it to fit in my pocket. If this section has '
                   "seemed lengthy it's because the B50 includes more useful "
                   'and valuable accessories than most other IEMs. The '
                   "accessory package is so great that most customers won't "
                   'need to consider cable or tip upgrades. Therefore, I am '
                   'increasing the weight of this category from ten points to '
                   'twenty. Since I took off half a point each for the lack of '
                   'memory wire and use of a right-angle connector in the '
                   '3.5mm cable, the B50 gets nineteen points. Overall, I am '
                   "very pleased with the B50's included accessories and feel "
                   'that they are competitive, if not a step above, the '
                   'competition. Comfort, Fit and Isolation – 9.5/10 I have '
                   'grouped these three together because I believe that for '
                   'IEMs they are all intimately related. If you don’t get a '
                   'good fit, the earphones are likely to be uncomfortable and '
                   'not isolate well. As discussed previously, the B50 comes '
                   'with five pairs of silicon tips and five pairs of foam '
                   'tips. It is vitally important that anyone using an IEM try '
                   'out all the different included tips to see which works '
                   "best for them. If the tip isn't sealing well you are going "
                   'to get weak bass and poor noise isolation. I liked how '
                   'Westone varies the length of the tip as well as the '
                   'thickness. This should allow most people to get a good fit '
                   'with one of the included tips. The tip material can affect '
                   'the sound and I found the silicon tips allowed the B50 to '
                   "sound slightly more detailed, although it wasn't a huge "
                   'difference. I also found the silicon tips to be more '
                   "comfortable, particularly the short pair, since it doesn't "
                   'go as deep into the ear. This was the pair of tips I '
                   'preferred while at home. Using the longer silicon tips '
                   'made me experience discomfort after about a half hour or '
                   'so. But foam tips are much better at blocking noise than '
                   'silicon tips, although they do have the disadvantage of '
                   'needing to be replaced more often as they get dirty and '
                   'lose their shape. Westone rates the B50 for 25 dB of noise '
                   'isolation, which they confirmed was with the included foam '
                   'tips. I was a bit surprised by this, as it is very close '
                   'to the 26 dB of noise isolation most custom IEMs are rated '
                   'for. But I can confirm that the B50 has an above average '
                   'amount of noise isolation when used with the longer foam '
                   'tips. I used these while commuting in a noisy city and on '
                   'a screeching subway and it did a great job blocking out '
                   'the noise. It was almost as good as a custom IEM, but not '
                   'quite there. That being said, I think the B50 with its '
                   'foam tips will be better than most other universal IEMs in '
                   'terms of noise isolation. When using these long foam tips, '
                   'I was able to wear them for about 30-45 minutes before '
                   'experiencing any discomfort, which was enough for what I '
                   'needed. But if I wanted to better balance comfort and '
                   "noise isolation, I would've tried the shorter foam tips. "
                   'When I said the design of the B50 was a bit bland, I also '
                   'said it was very functional. And fit is an area where this '
                   'comes into play. The earpiece shapes fit very well in the '
                   'ear and when I used the shorter silicon tips I could wear '
                   'them for hours at a time without any discomfort. '
                   "Additionally, I didn't find cable noise to be an issue "
                   "with either of the B50's included cables. This means that "
                   "when you walk or move around with them you won't notice "
                   'the sound of the cable running against your shirt. In '
                   'summary, I found the many included high-quality tips '
                   'combined with the ergonomic shape of the earpieces made '
                   'for a very comfortable fit and great noise isolation when '
                   'needed. Soundstage – 9.25/10 The soundstage is excellent '
                   'for an IEM. When listening to more complicated tracks the '
                   'imaging does a great job separating the different '
                   'instruments and vocals. Vocals in particular are close and '
                   'up front which makes the music more intimate. I listened '
                   'to some recordings on YouTube that vary the position of '
                   'the recording and I was able to easily track it moving '
                   'with the B50. That being said, I wouldn’t go so far to say '
                   'that the soundstage compares to an open headphone or an '
                   'open IEM such as Audeze’s iSINE series, but it does a '
                   'great job overall and I have no complaints. The amount of '
                   'detail and separation is going to depend on the quality of '
                   'your recordings. I found the B50 to be a bit less '
                   'forgiving than other IEMs but it really shines with high '
                   'quality recordings. Highs (Treble) – 9.25/10 The highs on '
                   'the B50 are better than I expected given the bass-heavy '
                   'tuning. Strings, piano notes and cymbals are all very '
                   'clear, with perhaps just the slightest hint of muddying '
                   'from the emphasized low end. On most songs I felt like the '
                   'highs sort of got out of the way. They provide sufficient '
                   'clarity and detail to let the low end shine. Mids – 8.5/10 '
                   'I have mixed feelings on the mids of the B50, and to me '
                   'they were definitely the weakest part of its sound. On '
                   'recordings with a significant low end there is a fair '
                   'amount of bleeding from the lows into the mids that '
                   'muddies the sound. I found this to be less of an issue on '
                   'higher quality recordings, and even less so on acoustic '
                   'recordings with less low end. On some recordings the mids '
                   'were good, with clear vocals and percussion that took '
                   'nothing away from my enjoyment of the music. Some purely '
                   'acoustic recordings even sounded great. But on some lesser '
                   'recordings vocals could be a bit muddy and piercing, and '
                   'drum hits a bit shallow and thin, lacking depth. This is '
                   "by no means to say that the mids are bad, as they aren't. "
                   'Someone hearing an IEM in this price range for the first '
                   "time will likely be amazed by the B50's. But this is an "
                   "area where the B50 didn't wow me. Lows (Bass) – 9.75/10 "
                   "Simply put, if you're a basshead, you will love the B50's "
                   'bass. I certainly do. It goes deep, with sub-bass being '
                   'well represented. The bass as a whole is emphasized, but '
                   'not out of control. Keep in mind that I prefer enhanced '
                   "bass, so it's entirely possible someone else might "
                   'disagree with me about it not being out of control. I '
                   'found the attack to be great, almost like a dynamic '
                   "driver. It has a bit of boom and rumble, but I wouldn't go "
                   "so far to say it's like a subwoofer, but it's getting "
                   'there. It hits far harder than most balanced armature IEMs '
                   'do. The accuracy is good in the sense that different bass '
                   'frequencies can be distinguished, but B50 unashamedly '
                   "doesn't claim to represent the recording as the artist "
                   'intended, with its emphasized bass. If I had to nitpick, '
                   "I'd say the decay is a bit faster than I would have liked. "
                   'Value – 9/10 I think the B50 is a fair value at its '
                   'current price, given its sound quality and extensive '
                   'accessory package. The sound combines the best sound '
                   'characteristics of a balanced armature design with '
                   "emphasized bass. And if that's what you're looking for I "
                   'think the B50 is competitive at its price point, and might '
                   "even be able to be an end-game IEM, if you don't want to "
                   'spend a lot more money in the future. The beauty of the '
                   'accessory package is that most customers will find it '
                   "adequate and won't have to spent another cent on the B50. "
                   'In the box you get a premium cable to use it wired, and an '
                   'adequate (although not state of the art) Bluetooth cable '
                   'in case you want to go wireless. To top it off, the '
                   'hardshell case can safely hold everything that comes in '
                   'the box. That being said, I would be remiss to not point '
                   'out that the B50 costs $699.99. While this might not seem '
                   'like a lot in a market where some flagship IEMs are now '
                   'going for $3,000+, it is far from an impulse purchase. '
                   'Most consumers would consider $300 to be expensive for an '
                   'audio product, and the B50 is going to be out of reach for '
                   'these people. But I do think Westone priced the B50 '
                   "perfectly, given the market. Any higher, and I'd probably "
                   'recommend people look at a custom IEM. On the other hand, '
                   'if the price falls in the future the B50 could become a '
                   'much better value. Selected Comparison Jerry Harvey JH 11 '
                   'Pro ($999.99) – The JH 11 Pro is a four-driver '
                   'configuration with dual low, a single mid and a single '
                   'high driver. I am going to preface this comparison by '
                   "saying it's pretty unfair to the B50. My JH 11s are "
                   'customs, but the added cost of them being custom is '
                   "probably canceled out by the B50's much better accessory "
                   'package. The JH 11 comes with only one barebones cable, '
                   "which although adequate, isn't as nice as the B50's. There "
                   "is no Bluetooth cable included. So assuming the B50's "
                   'accessory package cancels out the extra cost of the JH 11s '
                   'being custom fit, there is a $300 price difference between '
                   "the two (and this doesn't include the cost of getting ear "
                   "impressions made), so the JH 11s cost 42% more. But I'm "
                   'going to compare them anyway, since the JH 11s are the '
                   'nicest IEMs I have, and I think they have a similar sound '
                   "signature to the B50. As you'd probably expect given the "
                   'price difference, I like the sound of the JH 11 more, as '
                   'it combines a similarly powerful bass response with better '
                   'clarity in the mids and highs. To put it more simply, '
                   'while the B50 sounds great to me on most songs, the JH 11 '
                   'sounds great on almost all songs, no matter the genre. So, '
                   "I'd say the JH 11 Pro builds on the few sonic flaws the "
                   'B50 has. The custom fit also makes it unfair to compare '
                   'the bass between the two, as a good custom fit will give '
                   'the best possible seal and bass response. The JH 11 also '
                   'has slightly better noise isolation than the B50, as it '
                   'perfectly fills a large part of the ear. Although I had no '
                   "complaints with the B50's comfort, the JH 11s are more "
                   'comfortable, as would be expected with something custom '
                   "designed for the user's ear. In summary, while I'd "
                   'definitely choose the custom JH 11s over the B50, the '
                   'large price difference makes it an unfair comparison. I '
                   "was impressed by the B50's ability to somewhat hold its "
                   'own against the JH 11. Conclusion – 9.28/10 I will start '
                   'this conclusion by saying that if you are looking for a '
                   'neutral sound signature, or an IEM to use for professional '
                   'music applications, stay far away from the B50. You will '
                   'hate its colored sound. That being said, I think Westone '
                   'did a great job with the B50. It really shined with '
                   'hip-hop, rap and EDM music, as would be expected for an '
                   'IEM with great bass. It was also able to hold its own on '
                   'many acoustic recordings. Although it is not perfect, I '
                   'only had a few criticisms and most were minor. It combines '
                   'an audiophile-quality sound (although tuned for '
                   "bass-lovers) with a great accessory package. If you're a "
                   'basshead looking for an IEM in this price range, I '
                   'strongly suggest you check out the B50. Averaging out the '
                   'scores for all seven categories results in a score of '
                   '9.28/10. This is slightly above 4.5 stars, which is the '

                   'philosophy is "the result of the persistent search for '
                   'pure sound quality. Every BGVP job not only seeks to '
                   'satisfy the audience, but also wants to find the trust, '
                   'pleasure and taste of the listener. They have several '
                   'models behind them, such as the earbud DX3, the IEMs '
                   '1DD+2BA DS1, the 2DD+2BA SDM5, the famous 5BA DM5, the 6BA '
                   'DM7, the 12BA ArtMagic V12...On this occasion I will '
                   'analyze the new model 1DD+2BA, called ArtMagic DH3. This '
                   'model has many peculiarities, it has been printed on the '
                   '3D printing equipment of German Envision TEC and is made '
                   'of PMMA acrylic fiber material that does not damage the '
                   'skin, also improves the resistance to high temperatures '
                   'and impacts. Its drivers are the combination of an 8mm '
                   'dynamic driver, a BA of Knowles, model ED-26989, for the '
                   'mid frequencies and BA, also of Knowles, called RAF-33518, '
                   'for the high frequencies. Another particularity is the use '
                   'of 2 small switches that allow to modify the sound, with 4 '
                   'different types of tuning, to enhance each range of '
                   'frequencies, in order to satisfy a wide audience. It also '
                   'has a 4-way electronic crossover, to efficiently '
                   'distribute all frequency ranges, mixing them as coherently '
                   'as possible, to create a frequency response capable of '
                   'being used for long periods of listening. Finally, the '
                   'cable is composed of 8 high purity "5N single crystal" '
                   'copper cores, which avoids having to be replaced by '
                   'another cable, since the quality is so high that changing '
                   'it would be very expensive and unnecessary. Specifications '

                   'have been a dynamic driver of 8mm, for the low '
                   'frequencies, of biological diaphragm. For the mids, has '
                   'been implemented the BA of Knowles, ED-26989. Finally, for '
                   'the high frequencies, another Knowles BA is in charge, '
                   'model RAF-33518. All drivers are connected to improve the '
                   'resolution and provide a different sound. As a great '
                   'differentiating element, the DH3, have small switches, two '
                   'per capsule, which allow to modify the sound, generating 4 '
                   'different tunings. Thus, it is possible to emphasize the '
                   'lower zone, the midrange or the treble, in order to adjust '
                   'as best as possible to the taste of each one.It also has a '
                   '4-way electronic crossover, which provides very coherent '
                   'and accurate transitions. The MMCX connector is of high '
                   'quality, to avoid possible disconnections during use. The '
                   'cable consists of 8 high purity "5N single crystal" copper '
                   'cores. It is thick, but very suitable and manageable. It '
                   'has a semi-rigid coating to fit over the ear. Its color is '
                   'copper, covered with transparent plastic. The MMCX '
                   'connectors are covered by black and large cylinders, which '
                   'use red and blue rings as a channel mark. The splitting '
                   'piece is another smooth black cylinder with a soft barrel '
                   'shape. There is a small coin-shaped piece, made of '
                   'translucent white plastic, which serves as an adjustment '
                   'pin. The 3.5mm Jack connector cover is another large, '
                   'black, smooth metal cylinder. The cable has a Velcro strip '
                   'for safe retrieval. Great construction, great shape, great '
                   'cable and great finishes, at the height of its '
                   'presentation. Adjustment and Ergonomics The fit is good '
                   'and so is the comfort. But the mouthpieces are rather '
                   'short for those of us who, like me, have a big, deep ear '
                   'hole. But this allows the use of tri-flange tips. Rubber '
                   'washers can also be used as a buffer, making the simple '
                   'tips a little more separate from the body of the capsules. '
                   'In this way, a somewhat deeper insertion can be achieved. '
                   'Once this is corrected, the fit is firm and durable. The '
                   'cables are barely felt over the ear, offering good comfort '
                   'even when walking down the street. The insulation will '
                   'depend on the degree of sealing we get, with the tips '
                   'used. But if you get them right, the soundproofing '
                   'achieved is remarkable. Sound Profile The profile of the '
                   'DH3 may vary depending on the position of the switches. A '
                   'very, very balanced, flat profile up to 5kHz can be '
                   'achieved. Or vary to a warmer profile, slightly V. All '
                   'this without losing details and the fantastic midrange '
                   'they possess. Switch Positions 1 OFF - 2 OFF. In short '
                   'mode 00: mids enhancement. 1 ON - 2 OFF. In abbreviated '
                   'mode 10: Highlighting of mids and highs. 1 ON - 2 ON. In '
                   'abbreviated mode 11: Bass and mids enhancement. 1 OFF - 2 '
                   'ON. In abbreviated mode 01: Bass enhancement. Bass With '
                   'the switches in position 01, maximum bass boost is '
                   'achieved. It is very similar, also in position 11, but for '
                   'this case, there is an emphasis on voices, which is not '
                   'shown in the frequency response, but is audible. The lower '
                   'zone, in these positions, takes more prominence, but '
                   'without dominating the profile. The DH3 become warmer '
                   'IEMS, but without losing the presence in the voices it '
                   'possesses. In this way, the profile is animated, leaving a '
                   'more powerful bass medium, with a deeper and more '
                   'notorious sub-bass, but quite contained and without '
                   'arriving, with complete emphasis, in the lower zone. The '
                   'hit is never too powerful and the bassheads would be '
                   'somewhat disappointed with them. When the switches are '
                   'placed in position 00 or 10, the timbre or the texture of '
                   'the lower zone do not change, it only seems that the voice '
                   'is released from that lower zone heavier, becoming a more '
                   'agile IEM, but without losing the trace of the bass. In '
                   'reality, the decrease in presence in this area is clear, '
                   'but it is not a cut, but rather a matter of obtaining '
                   'balance. And if it is achieved. In fact, it is a great '
                   'signal, because you can enjoy, quietly, all the color and '
                   'nuance of the bass, in all positions. The bass always '
                   'feels fast and clean, with hardly any posus or negative '
                   'trace. Although it is true the influence on the voices of '
                   'the greatest warmth, in the positions of greatest presence '
                   'of bass. Mids The midrange of the DH3 is simply exemplary. '
                   'No matter how you position the switches, you can always '
                   'enjoy this range without reservations. Although it is '
                   'clear that in positions 00 and 10, the clarity of the mids '
                   'is maximum. For mid-range, I prefer positions 00 and 11. '
                   'But my maximum enjoyment of this range is with position '
                   '00. The first thing that calls the attention of the middle '
                   'zone of the DH3 is the execution, it is really precise, '
                   'but also relaxed. In addition, the environment in which it '
                   'develops, overflows absolute clarity and cleanliness. '
                   'Again, the light is very important in the result of the '
                   'sound of these IEMs. The DH3 are placed in that limbo of '
                   'luminous headphones, which bring so much joy to the '
                   'midrange. As I say, the definition deserves a separate '
                   'mention, especially in the voices. They are placed in the '
                   'position of the scene, where they are protagonists, in the '
                   'highest and closest, as if it were a diva. You only have '
                   'to look up and contemplate how they flow and stand out '
                   'from the rest of the instrumentation. The level of '
                   'resolution is very high, as is expected of a BA. But, on '
                   'this occasion, the driver has been sweetened so that it '
                   "doesn't sound too analytical, but light and precise, "
                   'halfway to naturalness, but impressively resolute. This '
                   'can be seen in the separation that the voices have from '
                   'the rest of the instruments. They are not left behind, but '
                   'by their side, respecting the space, recreating a very '
                   'immersive sensation: it is easy to dive among them, while '
                   'the voices are perceived. In general, balance and '
                   'equilibrium are great. On this occasion we perceive a '
                   'slightly more digital look, but without being unreal, that '
                   'analytical touch that shapes the sound. The great news is '
                   'that with the switches, you can gain in warmth, filing a '
                   'bit the defined profile of the middle zone. The midrange '
                   'of the DH3 is so good that it deserves a totally attentive '
                   'listening to be able to enjoy them without reservations. '
                   'Treble The highs are contained, as soon as they start they '
                   'drop in gain. Then they increase but without assuming '
                   'imbalance, nor an annoying emphasis. Thus, the upper zone '
                   'feels sweet and this hardly changes with the switches. '
                   'However, it is clear that in the unenhanced positions of '
                   'the lower zone, the highs sound freer and more '
                   'perceptible. In spite of this, the high details are felt '
                   'with clarity and a lot of definition, but with that soft '
                   "nuance, so characteristic in the headphones that I've been "
                   'analyzing lately. At the higher end, there is a slight '
                   'shortness of air. All in all, the DH3 offers a more '
                   'musical, pleasant and restrained sound than other IEMS '
                   'with BA drivers, but without falling into a dark, just '
                   'warm sound. Soundstage, Separation The scene is '
                   'characterized by the high resolution offered by DH3. And '
                   "it's almost bigger when it's tuned with less bass, as the "
                   'mids shine brighter. The proximity of the voices and their '
                   'relation with the rest of the instruments, the space that '
                   'exists, the good separation, the excellent location that '
                   'is generated... causes a reconstruction of the image from '
                   'the vocalists, where the whole scene expands from their '
                   'point of view. In instrumental or electronic music, the '
                   'image floats, equally defined, where the rest of the '
                   'elements take the leading role to widen the scene. The '
                   'proximity of the mids provides depth, because many sound '
                   'planes are established. The bass and treble extend the '
                   'image towards the sides. The details are precise and '
                   'placed in such a way that they impress for the price '
                   'level. There is so much air and space between elements '
                   'that listening becomes a rediscovery that almost forces '
                   'the listener to remain very attentive so as not to lose a '
                   'single nuance. Comparisons Moondrop Kanas Pro The first '
                   'comparison will be with one of my favorite IEMS: the Kanas '
                   'Pro. The DH3, without bass enhancement, have a similar '
                   'level in the lower part, although the Kanas Pro are one '
                   'point above, offering a beautiful depth and very tight '
                   'bass. The DH3, with bass enhancement, surpass them clearly '
                   'in the presence of bass. In addition, the BGVP are more '
                   'balanced and have more presence in the middle and first '
                   'highs, offering more extension in the upper zone. The '
                   'sound of the Kanas Pro, seems more concrete than that of '
                   'the DH3. It is something that is noticed in the mids, more '
                   'focused in the Pro. While in the DH3, they have this '
                   'tendency to expand and sound more ethereal. The timbre is '
                   'different, it could be said that they are conditioned by '
                   'their origin: the DH3 deliver more brightness and a '
                   'greater sense of projection, but also less concretion. The '
                   'Kanas have very compact mids, with a smaller projection, '
                   'but with a better definition, a little more body and a '
                   'less cold timbre. But the DH3 has a wonderful option, '
                   'which allows you to tune the sound. If the basses are '
                   "enhanced, the voices gain in warmth and body, and that's "
                   "where the Kanas Pro can't compete against that "
                   'versatility. At the level of separation and scene, I place '
                   'the DH3 above. There is a clear greater separation and a '
                   'more expansive scene. I also distinguish more details and '
                   "nuances in the DH3. But it's still a titan duel. DB Monroe "
                   'One of the IEMS that have surprised me lately, have been '
                   'the DB Monroe. They have a powerful lower part and some '
                   'balance in the middle zone, although their profile is '
                   'slightly U-shaped. The first thing to note is that the DH3 '
                   'are much more sensitive and give a much higher volume, at '
                   'the same level as the Monroe. Starting from the lower '
                   'zone, in the Monroe, its presence polarizes all the sound, '
                   'since it revolves around the lows. They are full of energy '
                   "and that's noticeable, it's a very big sound in this part, "
                   'not suitable for all audiences. The DH3, with bass '
                   'enhancement, do not get to have as much energy as the '
                   'Monroe. Besides, their sub bass is not as deep. Although '
                   'both have a similar color, the DH3 have greater speed and '
                   'their hit is more contained and exerts less pressure on '
                   'the ears. But, I insist, there are similarities in texture '
                   'and timbre, despite the difference in energy delivered. '
                   "The middle zone is more different. Monroe don't have mids "
                   'as close up as DH3 (no matter how the switches are). They '
                   'stay behind the bass area of the DBs. While in DH3, they '
                   'always glow. In this range there is a difference of timbre '
                   'and color, especially in the voices. The Monroe have more '
                   'warmth, smoothness, some darkness and the DH3 bring more '
                   'light and clarity, you notice more resolution and '
                   'definition. Although, comparatively speaking, there seems '
                   'to be a certain hollowness in the voices of the DH3, '
                   'because they have less body and warmth, but it is only '
                   'their cooler tendency, finer, more defined and higher '
                   'resolution. Absolutely, one notices the special treatment '
                   'that the mids have in the DH3, where they are the axis of '
                   'their sound. In the upper zone, both begin with the same '
                   'tendency, to decay at the beginning of the range. But, '
                   'however, later on, the DH3 fill the treble extension more '
                   'markedly, reaching more detail and a brighter complexion. '
                   'The trebles in Monroe are finer and sharper. In the DH3 '
                   'they have a greater projection, extending more, sounding '
                   'with more width and harmonics. This makes them even have a '
                   'little more softness, but actually gives the sound a '
                   'greater amount of air, a virtue that the Monroe do not '
                   'have. If we talk about scene and separation, the DH3 are '
                   'placed above. The amplitude of their sound is determined '
                   'by greater separation, more air, a higher resolution level '
                   'and more detailed definition. The expansion in the '
                   'midzone, which the DH3 have, dwarfs the more focused '
                   'scenario offered by the DB Monroe. Their greater '
                   'forcefulness in the lower zone cages a sound, which could '
                   'develop more; but not only they are guilty, but their '
                   'upper zone also penalizes in this sense. Finally, the '
                   'possibilities of tuning that the DH3 possess, favor him in '
                   'a direct confrontation, at sonorous level. In terms of '
                   'construction, both are very different. Monroe are '
                   'metallic, heavier, but smaller. DH3s are printed with '
                   'acrylic fiber, but they are bigger and thicker. This can '
                   'penalize their adjustment. The quality of the cable is '
                   'better than the one that comes with the Monroe. Both '
                   'packages are very good, but, in the case of Monroe, it has '
                   'a special and particular touch, which makes it very '
                   'difficult to beat. Conclusion I have to say, BGVP ArtMagic '
                   "DH3 has become another of my favorite IEMS. And it's not "
                   'their lower zone that convinced me, without it being a '
                   'reproach. It was their mids and the versatility of the '
                   'switches to tune the sound to our liking. The great scene, '
                   'the remarkable separation and the excellent location of '
                   'every detail, are other great virtues of these DH3. But it '
                   "doesn't end there, because to all that has been said, we "
                   'must add the level of construction, the cable, the '
                   'packaging, the accessories and the transport box. The BGVP '
                   'ArtMagic DH3 is a wise choice for those who cannot buy '
                   'several IEMS with different profiles, because they are '

                   'Unboxing / Packaging: The CCA C12 arrived in a black '
                   'lift-top box with a line drawing of the iem on the front '
                   'and the specs on the reverse.  The specs are a bit hard to '
                   'read depending on angle of lighting as it is black on '
                   'black.   Once you lift the top, you are greeted with the '
                   'earpieces resting in a tray with all other items hiding '
                   'underneath.   The kit is fairly sparse as it consists of '
                   'the earpieces, cable, three sizes of tips, and the '
                   'manual.   This is not a let down as we are talking a 12 '
                   "driver iem for less than $40.  I'd much rather companies "
                   'spend their money on R&D and better drivers than on cases, '
                   'extra tips, etc. Build/Fit: The C12 uses a 3 part shell '
                   'consisting of an outer metal faceplate, an inner plastic '
                   'shell and a metal nozzle.  Shape is a modified half circle '
                   'with the nozzle exiting the top front and the bi-pin '
                   'connector exiting the top rear.  The nozzle has almost no '
                   'rake so provides for fairly deep insertion but due to '
                   'materials, isolation is only average.  A single vent sits '
                   'over the dynamic driver offset slightly from the middle of '
                   'the driver to avoid the curvature of the nozzle.   The '
                   'face-plate has a lip around the the outer edge so it sits '
                   'partially in the plastics shell as seen in the pictures '
                   'below.  This is the opposite of most of the KZ made models '
                   'where the face-plate overlaps the shell. Seams are smooth, '
                   'machining of the face-plate is well done with no obvious '
                   'toolmarks and fit between parts is very good.   The C12 is '
                   'on the larger side, but sits fairly comfortably in ear and '
                   'does not approach the size of the Zs10 that was '
                   "uncomfortable for many. If  the Zs5 series didn't bother "
                   "you size wise, chances are the C12 won't either. "
                   'Internals: The C12, like its ZSX cousin, is a 6 driver per '
                   'side design using a single 10 mm dynamic driver to provide '
                   'low end grunt, four DWEK midrange balanced armatures to '
                   'bring the mids to life, and a single 30095 balanced '
                   'armature to give the highs a voice.    Nominal impedance '
                   'is listed as 24Ω with a sensitivity of 112dB/mW and is '
                   'nearly identical to the ZSX but unlike the A10 clones, '
                   'this one differs a bit in signature.    I did find the C12 '
                   'easy enough to drive from a smart-phone or tablet and '
                   'while quality benefits from better sources, an external '
                   'amp is really not necessary to run the C12 to its full '
                   'ability. Cable: CCA has stuck with using the brown KZ '
                   'cable thus far and the C12 retains it again.  I am not a '
                   'big fan as I find the splitter oddly placed which is then '
                   'compounded by the lack of a chin slider.  Luckily the '
                   'hooded-bi-pin style connector is now popular enough that '
                   'many replacement options are available.  I promptly '
                   'replaced the stock cable with an upgrade cable from '
                   'Nicehck designed for the Nx7 and it worked perfectly and '
                   'remedied some of the issues I have with the stock cable. '
                   'Sound: The C12 is tip sensitive and I found does its best '
                   'with narrow bore silicones.  I settled on a pair of '
                   'Spin-fits for my listening and testing. Bass: The C12 has '
                   'good sub-bass when called upon with roll-off only becoming '
                   'evident below 40Hz.  Mid-bass has slightly less emphasis '
                   'than the sub-bass but still provides good thump.  Mid-bass '
                   'attack is faster than decay and gives the bass a bit of '
                   'extra fullness.   Bass is not slow or muddy, and no big '
                   'bloom is present, but it does feel slightly thickened at '
                   'times.   The attack gives the kick drum a nice snap on the '
                   'initial hit and keeps the bass from sounding less '
                   'defined.   Overall, not a ton of detail in the bass, but a '
                   "nice thick presentation that won't leave the user wanting "
                   'for bass quantity. Mids: There is some mid-bass bleed that '
                   "colors the lower mids, but it isn't overstated and brings "
                   'some warmth to what might otherwise be a bit dry '
                   'presentation by the balanced armatures.   Mids start '
                   'moving forward about as quickly as they transition from '
                   'the bass while both male and female vocals have good '
                   'weight, female vocals are a bit more forward in the mix '
                   'and a bit more lively.  Mids have better detail than '
                   'expected at this price point and are surprisingly clean.  '
                   'String timbre is good but can be a slightly sharp-edged at '
                   'times as the boosted lower treble comes into play and '
                   'viola is typically a bit more natural than violin as a '
                   'result.   Guitar has good growl on electrics and fairly '
                   'natural sound for acoustics. Treble: CCA has been doing a '
                   'better job thus far with the 30095 in the treble than '
                   'their KZ counterparts and with this model,  although its '
                   'twin has improved, the CCA remains a step ahead with a '
                   'more linear and better tuned treble.   Treble stays very '
                   'level from 2kHz all the way through 6kHz before dropping '
                   'back.  This gives the presence region a bit of extra '
                   'energy without becoming harsh or fatiguing.   A later push '
                   'back up at 10kHz brings back some top end air and sparkle '
                   'without jumping way out in front of the rest of the '
                   'signature.   Treble detail is only average, but clarity is '
                   'good and extension is better than expected.  overall, this '
                   'may be the best tuned treble out of a KZ family member to '
                   'date. Soundstage / Imaging: This is where the C12 comes '
                   'back down to earth. Soundstage is only average for class '
                   'with considerably more width than depth and only minimal '
                   'height.   Instrument separation is above average and '
                   'seating the orchestra shows good positioning for the most '
                   'part although the stage feels a bit shallow and '
                   'instruments are pushed closer together front to back than '
                   'side to side in the presentation.  Imaging is fairly good '
                   'with spatial cues being well represented and movement '
                   'around the stage being fairly well articulated.  The '
                   'problem I have with the imaging is at times when a '
                   'vocalist moves in the mix it winds up behind the guitar or '
                   'strings as the C12 pushes that upper-mid more forward in '
                   'the mix.  This is particularly true of lower range vocals '
                   'in the baritone range. Comparison: Well after the recent '
                   'releases where we have seen multiple brandings on the same '
                   "iem, I thought we'd do a quick compare between the ZSX and "
                   'the C12 since they are at the very least fraternal '
                   'twins.   Both share the same drivers, cable, and nozzle '
                   'but differ in shell and faceplate and possibly '
                   'cross-over.    I find the ZSX to be slightly more '
                   'comfortable with its more ergonomic shape, but I find the '
                   'signature more pleasant on the C12 with a bit more treble '
                   'linearity.  No doubt these two share more in common than '
                   'not, but they are not the same exact iem as we saw in the '
                   'previous C10 round of releases. Thoughts / Conclusion: '

                   'development of the unit featured in the CA4, a dual magnet '
                   'design with a field strength of 1 Tesla. The balanced '

                   'Sliding open the box, you are presented with the IEMs in a '
                   'foam backing. The words “12 Units Hybrid Technology '
                   'Earphone” are printed below. Under this foam insert you '

                   'accents. There is an indented CCA logo in the centre '
                   'filled with gold colour. Along the edge of the earpieces '

                   'underside is finished in a smoked grey colour which '
                   'matches well with the faceplates. There are two pinhole '
                   'vents on the inner surface of the earpieces. The '
                   'detachable cable is identical to that supplied with the '

                   'between the chunky Y-split and the earpieces and as a '

                   'earphones were left burning in for over 72 hours before '
                   'testing and included tracks of white and pink noise, glide '
                   'tones and other audio conditioning tracks. After this I '
                   'used a Hifi Walker H2 DAP with a Fiio A5 amplifier and a '
                   'Sony NWZ-A15 for evaluation. The supplied medium Starline '
                   'tips were used but I changed the cable to a 16 core silver '
                   'plated one from TRN. (See below) The C12 displayed a '
                   'clean, clear sound profile with a powerful bass '
                   'foundation, open midrange and extended upper frequencies. '
                   'Detail retrieval was excellent and separation very good. '
                   'The soundstage was three-dimensional and extensive. Bass '
                   'The bass was well-controlled and displayed good extension, '
                   'with the lowest frequencies handled cleanly and with good '
                   'texture. Messaien’s “Desseins Eternels” performed by Louis '
                   'Thiry has some extremely low organ tones and the C12 '
                   'passed this severe test with flying colours, reaching down '
                   'to the lower 30Hz regions at the same time maintaining '
                   'good timbre and resolution. In 1989, Canadian electronic '
                   'music duo Francois Kiraly and Charles Crevier released a '
                   'beautiful spacemusic album “Calypso”. “Castaway” ffeatures '
                   'a plaintive melody underpinned by deep bass synth patches '
                   'ON the C12, they possessed depth and impact and '
                   'complemented the string and flute sounds perfectly. David '
                   'Essex’s “Rock On” benefits from a superb production by '
                   'Jeff Wayne (“War of the Worlds”). A prominent deep bass '
                   'guitar forms the foundation for this track and it was '
                   'beautifully reproduced by the C12 with an attractive '
                   '“growl”. Brass and percussion remained clean and incisive '
                   'with good stereo imagery. Midrange The midrange was '
                   'perfectly balanced with the bass and treble and did not '
                   'suffer from bass bleed, nor was it recessed. It displayed '
                   'a typical CCA tonality with good clarity, detail and '
                   'resolution. There was a mild lift towards the upper '
                   'boundary with the treble which endowed this area with '
                   '“sparkle”, and brought vocals somewhat forward in the mix. '
                   'Enya’s “Echoes in Rain” from her “Dark Sky Island” album '
                   'was a good example of this with lyrics clearly enunciated '
                   'even allowing for the very powerful bass-driven '
                   'accompaniment, and the character of Enya’s voice nicely '
                   'preserved. MIDI guitarist Mark Dwane has revisited his '
                   'first album “Monuments of Mars” in his latest opus, '
                   '“Martian Apparitions”. Well-known for his audiophile '
                   'standard recordings, this certainly applied here. In '
                   '“Galaxis Chaos" the crisp, clean lead synth line stood out '
                   'clearly from the powerful driving accompaniment, resulting '
                   'in a very exciting presentation. Classical music also '
                   'fared well, with Bax’s “Tintagel” showing an orchestra in '
                   'full flight. Swirling string parts combined with snarling '
                   'brass interjections in the dramatic introduction, to be '
                   'followed by a beautifully expressed main theme in the '
                   'strings set against a rocking woodwind accompaniment. '
                   'Treble The treble had good extension and timbre. '
                   'Separation was above average, enabling subtle details to '
                   'emerge. In the Minuet from John Ireland’s “Downland Suite” '
                   'by the English String Orchestra, the lead melody was '
                   'nicely detailed with the differentiation of various '
                   'instruments clearly defined. The lively accompaniment '
                   'showed excellent timing and the counterpoint was easy to '
                   'follow. Deuter’s “Petite Fleur” from the album “Land of '
                   'Enchantment” features a lead melody resembling a music '
                   'box. The attractive theme shone out clearly above the '
                   'guitar and synthesised background and displayed a '
                   'well-reproduced ambience. The high synth tones towards the '
                   'conclusion were clear and pure in tone. The drums and '
                   'percussion in Linton Kwesi Johnson’s “Man Free” cut '
                   'through the production wonderfully. Sly Dunbar’s drumming '
                   'here was exemplary, dovetailing beautifully with Robbie '
                   'Shakespeare’s bass, with the high hats in the instrumental '
                   'break superbly clean and incisive. Soundstage The C12 '
                   'possessed an extensive panoramic soundstage, excellent '
                   'layering and first-class separation. Jean-Michel Jarre’s '
                   '“First Rendezvous” impressed greatly in this regard with '
                   'the initial deep synthesiser drone echoing menacingly and '
                   'the various string synth layers well-defined. Stereo '
                   'imaging on this track was superb with electronic effects '
                   'moving around the stage in entertaining fashion and the '
                   'dynamic conclusion to the piece powerfully portrayed. The '
                   'beautiful flute solo in Stuart Mitchell’s “Mausoleum at '
                   'Halicarnassus” from his “Seven Wonders Suite” floated '
                   'delicately above the orchestral accompaniment. Breath '
                   'sounds could be heard clearly and the ambience of the '
                   'recording venue added to the atmosphere, especially at the '
                   'end of the track where the natural decay of the timpani '
                   'could be heard in the distance. Dave Brubeck’s “Take '
                   'Five”took you to the sudio in authentic style with the '
                   'performers laid out in a natural acoustic. Saxophone solo '
                   'and bass in the centre, drums on the left and piano on the '
                   'right. Joe Morello’s amazing drum solo came over superbly '
                   'with a wonderful metallic sound to the cymbals and the '
                   'timbre of the various drums nicely differentiated. '
                   'Conclusion CCA seem to raise the bar with each successive '
                   'release. After the impressively-detailed C16 and the '
                   'accurate “warts and all” sound of the A10, the C12 adds a '
                   'powerful bass foundation to the detail and precision of '
                   'the earlier models. Boasting an impressive soundstage with '
                   'excellent layering and separation, it has a largely '
                   'neutral signature with an attractive sparkle in the upper '
                   'register, and I feel it is the most accomplished IEM from '
                   'CCA so far. Its closest competitor is the new KZ ZSX which '
                   'shares the same components housed in a different shell and '
                   'configuration. The ZSX has a deeper sub-bass presentation, '
                   'a warmer overall tone and an immense soundstage, but does '
                   'not display the same precision or detail retrieval as the '
                   'C12. It makes for a more relaxing listen, whereas the C12 '
                   'majors on detail and has a more incisive transient nature. '
                   'Both are excellent IEMs and the choice between them will '
                   'be largely a preference of sound signature. N.B. The '
                   'comparison between the ZSX and C12 was carried out using '
                   'the stock cable and tips on both models to obtain an '

                   'pair of stainless steel retaining clips. It can be '
                   'expanded and enclose the wire portion snugly. Both side is '
                   'slot into the holes aligned with the rubber housing. The '
                   'metal clips will click into place with the outer metal '
                   'housings. Step 4: Nozzle and Housing Assembly. Removable '
                   'nozzles with metal mesh. The housing with rubber seal. The '
                   'angled part is faced towards the rear. The kit provided 6 '
                   'types of foams and materials for filtering. It ranges from '
                   'unfiltered, low to high density foams. Unfortunately in my '
                   'case, all the filters disintegrated due to aging(I presume '
                   'it was stored for some time). I run the IEM without filter '
                   'for this test(Would probably play around with the filters '
                   'in the future). The instructions also encourage the user '
                   'to try with different materials to find the preference '
                   'sound. The nozzle and housing assembly. The nozzle is '
                   'screwed on and can be easily removed. Step 5: Gluing the '
                   'outer housing to the wire and BA assembly. After gluing '
                   'the rear portion of the housing, slide the assembly into '
                   'the metal housing. After a satisfying click, the assembly '
                   'is finished. Time to listen! The kit also provided 6 pairs '
                   'of eartips. 3 pairs of wide bore(S,M,L) and narrow '
                   'bore(S,M,L) for tip rolling. I prefer the wide bore which '
                   'boost a tad bit of low end compare to narrow bore tips. = '
                   'Fit and Comfort = \u200b First of all, Heaven II is slim '
                   'and light weight, it should fit straight right into your '
                   'ear. It is very comfort and I have no problem wearing it '
                   'for a long time. With the provided tips, it isolates quite '
                   'well against some ambient noise. = Sound = \u200b The '
                   'source for testing are my smartphone and my Sony NW-A45 '
                   'Walkman. Both running Heaven II unamped and without any '
                   'EQ. The eartip is the stock wide bore medium provided '
                   'along the package. Bass : The bass is adequate, but lacks '
                   'some extension to the deep down. It is punchy, accurate '
                   'and not overshadow any aspect. But a little more oomph and '
                   'quantity would really appreciated. But being a single BA '
                   'configuration, the bass is accurate and the speed is '
                   'appreciated during complex instruments and songs. Mid : '
                   'This is where the strong suit of the Heaven II. The mids '
                   'are lush and natural, but not in a clinical style or '
                   'signature. The male and female vocals sound so desirable '
                   'and really articulates. In live recordings, they sounded '
                   'natural and smooth. A slice of Heaven in your ears. High : '
                   'For the treble, it does not extend as much as the mids and '
                   'rolls-off a little. This is good which I can listen for '
                   'quite some time without fatiguing highs. But it still have '
                   'some sibilance on certain track, YMMV. In this case, I '
                   'think the high, like the bass, is taking a back seat in '
                   'this IEM. Soundstage : The soundstage might not be crazy '
                   'wide, nor the best details, but it has good imaging, and '
                   'good amount of airiness on top. It is intimate and '
                   'relaxing. = Value/Price = \u200b I bought this unit from a '
                   'fellow member in an audio marketplace section in my local '
                   'internet forum. It is priced around US$60 at the time I '
                   'bought it. For this price, it provided the pleasure of '
                   'DIY, building your own IEM as well having your own '
                   'signature in sound which made available by the removable '

                   'through the assembly, giving some patience and rewarded by '
                   'the listening session with a slice of Heaven(Pun '

                   "for it's price range and it's mid-range performance. The "
                   'materials from construction wise and sound quality are '
                   'impeccable. It really separates itself from clinic, '
                   'analytic sound; instead it provides a relaxing, intimate '
                   'listening session for you to relax and unwind. In the end, '
                   'this is my first full-length review of an IEM in this '

                   'treble energy and thus they lack a crispness to the sound. '

                   'V90 has a three-part, all-metal housing with a triangular '
                   'cross-section. The longest edge of the triangle faces '

                   'by the IEM is muffled and must be gently tugged away from '

                   'ear-guides without memory wire. The TRN logo is printed on '
                   'the 3.5mm jack housing. There is no chin-adjustment '

                   'intended to be worn cable-up only. The V90 has a deeper '
                   'than average insertion depth and I was able to get a good '
                   'seal using the stock eartips. I found the V90 very '
                   'comfortable to wear for long periods. Isolation is above '
                   'average, and I have not received any complaints about '
                   'sound leakage (in comparison to the TRN H1, for which I '
                   'have received complaints at equivalent volumes). SOUND: '
                   'The TRN V90 has a bassy V-shaped tuning. The V90 does not '
                   'have a mid-bass hump, instead emphasizing sub-bass over '
                   'mid-bass. Sub-bass extension is striking. The bass region '
                   'as a whole is elevated above the lower midrange. There is '
                   'abundant rumble and powerful slam. The bass has average '
                   'speed and articulation and can become confused and '
                   'indistinct during complicated, bass-heavy passages. This '
                   'is most evident in heavy varieties of electronic dance '
                   'music. The bass is highly textured but can be boomy and '
                   'borderline overwhelming. Although the lower midrange is '
                   'recessed compared to the mid-bass, male vocals retain good '
                   'intelligibility and have plenty of warmth and body. Female '
                   'vocals are a bit further forward than male vocals. The '
                   'overall timbre is realistic. There is enough presence to '
                   'give distorted electric guitars bite without being '
                   'fatiguing. The treble is energetic but surprisingly '
                   'smooth. Transients are crisp without being unrealistically '
                   'quick. There is a healthy amount of sparkle and air. '
                   'Overall resolution and detail retrieval are middling. '
                   'Soundstage, imaging and instrument separation are average '
                   'for a budget multi-BA hybrid. MEASUREMENTS: My '
                   'measurements were conducted with a Dayton iMM-6 microphone '
                   'using a vinyl tubing coupler and a calibrated USB sound '
                   'interface. The measurements use a compensation file '
                   'derived from relating my raw measurements with Crinacle’s '
                   'published measurements. The measurements are presented '
                   'with 1/24th smoothing. The magnitude of the valley at 7k '
                   'is a coupler artifact. There is a resonant peak around 8k. '
                   'Measurements above 10k are not reliable. AMPLIFICATION '
                   'REQUIREMENTS AND SOURCE PAIRING: The TRN V90 can be driven '
                   'to comfortable listening volumes with a smartphone or '
                   'dongle. There is noticeable hiss with some sources. '
                   'COMPARISONS: TRN V90 vs Blon BL-03 The Blon BL-03 uses a '
                   'single carbon nanotube dynamic driver. It has a more '
                   'neutral sound signature, with a much more restrained bass '
                   'presentation and a less forward upper midrange and treble '
                   'response. The BL-03 has better bass definition and '
                   'articulation. It is much easier to get a good seal using '
                   'stock tips with the V90. Because I need to use double '
                   'flange tips with the BL-03, the V90 is more comfortable. '
                   'The BL-03 has worse driver flex. The V90 is easier to '
                   'drive but is much more prone to hiss. The V90 does not '
                   'come with a bag or carry case, while the BL-03 comes with '
                   'a Blon-branded pouch. KZ ZSX vs TRN V90 The KZ ZSX is a '
                   'six-driver (5BA+1DD) hybrid IEM. The two IEMs have very '
                   'similar tunings, but the V90 is bassier than the ZSX and '
                   'has a more elevated lower treble response. Despite this, '
                   'the V90’s treble is smoother-sounding than the ZSX’s. The '
                   'V90 has more defined, better-articulated bass than the '
                   'ZSX. The V90’s upper midrange is a touch more forward than '
                   'the ZSX but has no issues with sibilance. The V90 has '
                   'better clarity and detail retrieval. The V90 has better '
                   'imaging. The V90 has slightly worse driver flex. The V90 '
                   'has less hiss. The V90 is more comfortable. CLOSING WORDS: '
                   'The TRN V90 is a great-sounding budget hybrid IEM with an '
                   'annoying usability concern which prevents me from '
                   'recommending it without qualification. If the venting '
                   'issue sounds manageable to you, it replaces the CCA-C10 as '

                   'allow the bass to dictate the performance. Maybe image '

                   'necessary to reduce 2 & 8 KHz bands to avoid peak '

                   'of the NX7. The BA driver of DB3 doesn’t match this level '
                   'of energy, but does manage to negate any transient peak '
                   'issues – however, this smoothing out process, of the mids '
                   'and treble, doesn’t reduce their excitement level one iota '

                   'single DD driver of the Blon excel at pushing the mids '
                   'upfront, extending them way more forward. This helps to '
                   'really appreciate the timbre of instruments, improving '
                   'their separation and layering - but can (on some tracks) '
                   'perceptibly be noticed to be at the cost of bass response. '

                   'well above their weight in comparison to similar budget '

                   'an outer zinc alloy faceplate, an inner transparent '
                   'plastic shell, and a metal nozzle that appears brass or '
                   'chrome plated depending on shell color selected.  I would '
                   'classify shell size as medium-large with the height and '
                   'width being larger than the depth.   The Exterior has some '
                   'aesthetic details, but no vents or functional components.  '
                   'The inner shell houses the drivers, connector, and nozzle '
                   'and most of the components are easily visible.   There is '
                   'a single vent over the dynamic driver.  The DB3 fits '
                   'better than I initially thought it might for me because it '
                   'is fairly thin.   Nozzles exit with a slight forward rake '
                   'and insertion is fairly shallow. Internals: The DB3 is a 3 '
                   'driver hybrid consisting of a coaxial dual dynamic driver '
                   'with a graphene diaphragm and a titanium dome material '
                   'along with a custom tuned 30095 balanced armature driver '
                   'to provide the top end.    Nominal impedance is listed as '
                   '16Ω with a sensitivity of 106 dB/mW.   I found the DB3 to '
                   'be easy to drive from a phone tablet and while quality '
                   'scaled with better sources, I do feel that an external amp '
                   'helps bring out the best in the DB3 but is not entirely '
                   'necessary to get acceptable performance. Cable: The cable '
                   'will be familiar to those who have other recent releases '
                   'from Nicehck as it has the now standard 90º 3.5mm Jack,  '
                   'the 4 wire double twist cable from jack to splitter, a '

                   'Bass: Bass is one of the stars of this show with sub-bass '
                   'and mid-bass both elevated above the rest of the '
                   'signature, but very tastefully so.   The bass is not '
                   'sloppy or loose and texture is better than expected on a '
                   '$20 in-ear by a considerable margin.  Sub-bass has good '
                   "rumble when called upon, but doesn't attempt to turn every "
                   'song into a bass show like some do.  Mid-bass falls from '
                   'the sub-bass peak to the mids and provides ample thump '
                   'without obstructing other elements behind it.   With a '
                   'string of less than spectacular offerings from NiceHCK of '
                   'late, I was expecting more of the same, so this was a nice '
                   'change of pace.  Bass is lively enough to command your '
                   'attention, but not hot enough to take over the joint.  '
                   'There is slight mid-bass bleed into the lower mids that '
                   'carries a bit of warmth with it, and at times does hide a '
                   'little detail in that region. Mids: The transition between '
                   'mid-bass and mids is probably the least emphasized portion '
                   'of the signature but does still manage to have more '
                   'presence than expected and never really gave the '
                   'impression of being recessed as much as just not '
                   'particularly emphasized.  Mids do climb forward as you '
                   'move up and give both male and female vocals very good '
                   'weight and presence with female vocals being maybe 1/2 '
                   'step in front but again both are well presented.   Guitars '
                   'are well rendered with the electric having a slightly more '
                   'natural tone than its acoustic sibling.  Violins are '
                   'passable but are not the wheelhouse of the driver and do '
                   'sound a bit less fluid than high end models.  (Again its '
                   '$20, what did I expect?)   I keep coming back to the '
                   'vocals as they are something special for an iem at this '
                   'price as they always sit in front the same distance '
                   'regardless of the volume of what is going on around them.  '
                   'The quietest passage or the biggest hit, both have the '
                   'vocal staged equally.  Impressive. Treble: I think one of '
                   'the smart moves NiceHCK made with the DB3 was using a '
                   'single ba to handle the upper duties rather than trying to '
                   'pack a bunch more drivers in for a techno dog and pony '
                   'show like so many of the recent releases have become.    '
                   "Treble isn't the most even I have heard with some regions "
                   'being considerably more emphasized than others, but it '
                   'stays clean throughout and provides a bit of extra energy '
                   'that open up the top end and give the DB3 good air and '
                   'some sparkle even without getting strident or harsh in the '
                   'process.   Cymbals are slightly metallic at times, but '
                   'better than expected at this price.  Snare hits are not as '
                   'crisp as upper models, but rattle is clean and well '
                   'defined. Soundstage / Imaging: Soundstage is wider than '
                   'deep but has solid dimensions so not over-crowded and '
                   'manages some sense of height.   Instrument separation is '
                   'on par with others in its class (average).  Seating the '
                   'orchestra is fairly straight forward with no large '
                   'anomalies or oddities but the orchestra does end up being '
                   'wider and shallower than a standard seating chart.   '
                   'Layering is better than expected as the coaxial driver '
                   'does a good job handling this.  Imaging is good with '
                   'spatial cues readily recognizable and movement around the '
                   'stage easy to track.   There is some minor compression as '
                   'tracks get exceptionally complex but well within the '
                   'expected at $20. Thoughts / Conclusion: For awhile, I had '
                   'found NiceHCK to be a good value as they made several '
                   'solid models at good prices.  The Height of that was '
                   'probably the M6.  Unfortunately, since then, NiceHCK had '
                   'taken a turn and produced a string of models that were '
                   'tuned with very forward treble, or were techno dog and '
                   'pony shows to show they could do Piezo, Planar, etc...     '
                   'I had begun to think the best days for NiceHCK might be '
                   "behind them as I hadn't really had anything since the M6 "
                   'that I thought showed more of that same magic.   The DB3 '
                   '(and the Nx7 in fairness) have done a good job in '
                   'restoring my faith in NiceHCK.    The two models '
                   'complement each other well as the DB3 is definitely a V '
                   'with more pronounced bass than the Nx7 and will appeal to '
                   'those listening to Pop, EDM, and Rock while the Nx7 is '
                   'better tuned for Jazz, strings, and orchestra works.     '
                   'If you are in the market for a new in-ear, you could a lot '
                   'worse than the DB3.  It can hit with good authority when '
                   'called upon, fade to black when asked to, and those '
                   'vocals, they just grab your attention and hold it.   This '

                   'end of the read. Build wise they are fairly solid. Housing '
                   'is comprised of a zinc alloy shell and plastic. This is '
                   'the exact same build as many KZ, CCA, and now NiceHCK '
                   'earphones. The housing size is medium/ smallish for sheer '

                   'like that NiceHCK is using more 2 pins on their earphones '
                   'now. I think they realized there are less problems when '
                   'using 2 pins so it makes logical sense to design newer '
                   'earphones with 2 pins. .78mm 2 pins apply on these so any '
                   'of the standard 2 pins will fit these well. The tuning has '
                   'turned for the much better on their retail version vs the '

                   'for a great sounding product. As compact as the design '
                   'here is somehow they did it. These are bassy but don’t '
                   'sound congested or too up in your face or too V in '
                   'balance. In fact the stage actually seems to have an '
                   'expansion in width and height/depth that seems to stretch '
                   'a bit beyond the shells. The stage of sound has '
                   'limitations due to the housing. Stages is somewhat similar '
                   'to the NX7. About average in width and depth but the use '
                   'of space is fantastic on the sound of the DB3. The '
                   'tonality and ability of the DB3 sounds more like a dynamic '
                   'based earphone than a BA based one which is usually not '
                   'the norm for hybrids. What this gets you is a very nice '

                   'already very good in terms of connectivity, the Shuttles '

                   'Quality and Battery Build quality is good but not '

                   'pretty solid but the charging station has a sort of loose '

                   'single charge of the dock station but I stopped myself '

                   'do not know if they’re related products or if they sound '
                   'similarly, but you can find some comparisons online and on '

                   'they fit well in my ears but I personally prefer the old '

                   'design and shape but fit can be tricky if you have small '

                   'critical factor that decides if something has to be tried '
                   'or not: how do they sound? Personal preferences: I mainly '
                   'listen to EDM subgenres, from Dupstep and Future Bass to '
                   'some more genres which represent a niche in the music '
                   'market. I even like listening to vocal tracks (moreover '
                   'from female singers like Sia) and sometimes Rock tracks. I '
                   'always search for IEMs that have a little bit of emphasis '
                   'in the lower region, and can sacrifice mids with some '
                   'recession if they still sound clear and natural. I love '
                   'vivid and sparkling highs if they’re not at a headache '
                   'level. Soundstage has to be at least average with a bit of '
                   'air. V-shape signature is my favourite one. Lows : lows '
                   'are emphasized with good sub-bass response. The Shuttle '
                   'are certainly bassy but the bass has a sort of '
                   '“mainstream” style that makes it punchy but not highly '
                   'precise. In this case, bass was good out-of-the-box while '
                   'I remember I have had some distortion problems with the '
                   'Ace in the first days, which disappeared after some use. '
                   'Mids : mids are recessed but in a different way than on '
                   'the Ace. The Shuttle have recessed midrange with upper '
                   'midrange being some dBs even lower. Female voices sound a '
                   'bit off while male voices are ok. Instruments are not '
                   'highly textured but this is understandable considering the '
                   'bass bleed and the midrange recession. Highs : highs are '
                   'not fatiguing at all but details are sacrified. This is '
                   'the kind of upper range for the ones who do not pretend to '
                   'have a top notch upper end with tons of details, and for '
                   'ones that just search for a comfortable and easygoing pair '
                   'of IEMs with warm treble. Soundstage is average, less '
                   'expansive than Ace’s soundstage. Imaging is ok but '
                   'instrument separation really struggles with complex '
                   'tracks. If I had to choose between them and the Ace, I '
                   'would take the Ace hands down. I prefer them in terms of '
                   'sound, but this is just a matter of personal preference, '
                   'even if I think that the Ace are superior in terms of '
                   'technical performance (I do not know if the driver is the '
                   'same, but it’s safe to say that they perform a bit '
                   'different if they are, maybe because of the shell). '
                   'Summary Dudios keeps offering good products with a nice '
                   'value for money. The Dudios Shuttle sound just right, '
                   'being durable in terms of battery and comfortable. '
                   'However, the new Dudios Shuttle should have a lower price: '
                   'placing the Shuttle near the price at which the Ace are '

                   'Ace have better battery and a bit better sound, maybe a '
                   'bit different because of the different shell. For the ones '

                   'for example. The quantity and unbooming nature of the '
                   'basses offered here finally allow the rest of the '
                   'registers to express themselves while providing a solid '
                   'foundation for the music. Mids : The midrange is more matt '
                   'and dense on the PP8 and more open and airy on the S8Pro, '
                   'but with a very pleasant sensuality for both. The Low-Mids '
                   '(250 to 500Hz) is quite close and in the continuity of the '
                   'basses on the 2 sets. If we assume that the Mids (500 to '
                   '2000Hz) and High-Mids (2000 to 4000Hz) of the PP8 are '
                   'neutral, we obtain a Mids a little behind on the S8Pro. '
                   'Both men and women have slightly less warm voice tones. '
                   'But at the same time, the High-Mids a little ahead allows '
                   'to bring shine to these same voices and notes. The sound '
                   'of the PP8 seems fuller but less luminous in comparison. '
                   'The 4000Hz peak of the S8Pro can also be a little annoying '
                   'for some people depending on the recordings. In '
                   'comparison, Trinity Low-Mids are a litlle more recessed '
                   'and Mids are even deeper and airier. The High-Mids is more '
                   'flourishing, promoting development of harmonics and '
                   'timbres efflorescence. Highs : The treble extension is '
                   'quite similar on both in-ears. But due to the 4KHz peak of '
                   'the S8Pro which extends a little beyond that, the high '
                   'frequencies seem a little less present. They also seem a '
                   'slightly less accurate on the S8Pro, more floating. '
                   'Relaxed and pleasant on the 2 pairs, they offer a '
                   'beautiful resonance on the cymbals and allow them to have '
                   'enough space to flourish. A nice success without '
                   'brilliance. In comparison, the highs of the Trinity are '
                   'quite similar to those of the S8Pro in terms of quantity '
                   'but sound more natural, much more accurate and much more '
                   'aerated. Soundstage: With the PP8, we have a very wide but '
                   'relatively shallow sounstage, height is rather average. '
                   'With the S8Pro, we move back a few rows in the audience '
                   'but the singers are not closer to the musicians. The depth '
                   'and width therefore improves slightly, as does the height. '
                   'However, we remain below the Zeus XIV in terms of width '
                   'and the Trinity for depth and height. The Magic Square: As '
                   'a result of the above, S8Pro seem to have a little more '
                   'resolution and separation than PP8, except in the high '
                   'frequencies where PP8 take over. Definition and '
                   'transparency seem to be of the same kind on both 8 BAs. It '
                   'should be noted, however, that S8Pro are more sensitive '
                   'and dependent on recordings than PP8, which can sometimes '
                   'increase recording whisper and bring out small '
                   'imperfections. In comparison, separation and resolution '
                   'are better on Trinity, transparency and definition are a '
                   "little higher too. Final Thoughts : As always, it's all "
                   'about favorite taste. If you want a soft, matte, dense and '
                   'perfectly balanced sound, the PP8 are made for you. They '
                   'will allow you to listen to your favorite songs for hours '
                   'without fatigue by highlighting the production work. '
                   'However, some might say that they are a little boring, '
                   'flat and dull. If you want a little spice and clarity '
                   'without denaturing your songs and moving too far from a '
                   'balanced playback, the S8Pro is for you. Gamblers and '

                   'article is originally posted on Headphonesty . Thank you, '
                   'Elle Zhou, from BQEYZ for sending me the Spring 1. The '
                   'products were provided to me free of charge in exchange '
                   'for my honest review and opinion.[/note] Introduction '
                   'BQEYZ is an in-ear monitor (IEM) manufacturer from China. '
                   'Unlike many manufacturers, BQEYZ is involved at every '
                   'point of their products’ development: from design to '
                   'development and even to production. "Engaging the service '
                   'of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can potentially '
                   'save a manufacturer a lot of cost. However, BQEYZ strives '
                   'to keep it all in-house." Triple hybrid IEMs, like BQEYZ’s '
                   'Spring 1, utilize three different types of drivers to '
                   'cover the sound spectrum. The strengths of some types of '
                   'driver cover the weaknesses of the other types. This can '
                   'improve the overall performance of an IEM compared to '
                   'conventional non-hybrid configurations. Elle Zhou, the '
                   'person in-charge of BQEYZ, notified me in June 2019 of the '
                   'Spring 1 release. I am fortunate to be selected to review '
                   'this new flagship from BQEYZ. In this review, I will bring '
                   'you through the Spring 1’s amazing journey! Unboxing The '
                   'packaging of BQEYZ Spring 1 is classy. The outer sleeve is '
                   'black with a photo of IEMs, the model name, and BQEYZ’s '
                   'logo. Removing the outer sleeve, you’re greeted by a hard '
                   'black box with a silver logo printed on the top corner. '
                   'Opening the hard box, Spring 1 officially makes its first '
                   'appearance to the happy recipient. The metallic faceplate '
                   'caught my attention immediately. There is an accessory box '
                   'in the lower part of the inner box. Opening the accessory '
                   'box, users find a black semi-hard case. The following '
                   'accessories are included in the semi-hard case: 6 pairs of '
                   'silicone ear tips 3 pairs for “Atmosphere”: - with smaller '
                   'bore to enhance the bass performance 3 pairs for '
                   '“Reference”: - with wider bore to produce a more neutral '
                   'sound signature A pair of foam ear tips 8 core 0.78mm '
                   '2-pin 3.5mm unbalanced silver-plated copper (SPC) cable '
                   'Technical Specifications Driver configuration : Triple '
                   'hybrid - a 13mm dynamic driver, a balanced armature (BA) '
                   'driver, and a 7-layer piezoelectric driver Impedance : 43Ω '
                   'Sensitivity: 108dB Frequency Response: 7Hz-40kHz Build '
                   'Upon opening the box, I was immediately sold on the '
                   'physical appearance of Spring 1. She is a distinctive and '
                   'attractive IEM. The faceplate is glossy. Unlike other '
                   'brands from China who source shells from OEMs, BQEYZ works '
                   'hard to present a unique IEM to customers, internally and '
                   'externally. BQEYZ uses an aluminium shell when crafting '
                   'Spring 1. This gives Spring 1 a premium look. I chose the '
                   'black color and the combination exceeds my expectation. By '
                   'using 5-axis computer numerical control (CNC) cutting '
                   'mechanism, the shell produced is smooth and free of sharp '
                   'edges which would otherwise cause discomfort when worn. '
                   'The nozzle is made of aluminium, too. I have seen a lot of '
                   'broken plastic nozzles when users change ear tips, so this '
                   'is an important selling point for me. The nozzle is often '
                   'a fragile section of an IEM and I am glad BQEYZ paid '
                   'special attention to it. On top of the shell, there is a '
                   'slightly-recessed 2-pin port. I am glad that BQEYZ is '
                   'using a conventional 2-pin connector for this model. It '
                   'makes cable rolling easy. The cable provided in the box is '
                   'an eight core 0.78mm 2-pin 3.5mm unbalanced SPC cable. '
                   'There is a heat-shrink ear guide without metal wire in it. '
                   'I like this type of ear guide because those with a metal '
                   'wire will create noise when walking, with the metal wire '
                   'clicking against spectacles. Moving down the cable, the '
                   'Y-splitter is grey in color and includes a neck slider '
                   'which I found very useful. The 3.5mm jack has the same '
                   'color scheme as the Y-splitter and there is a strain '
                   'relief to provide additional durability. Fit and Isolation '
                   'I spent a lot of time here to find the ear tips that give '
                   'me the best isolation. The provided ear tips are too short '
                   'to sit well in my long and deep ear canals. Eventually, I '
                   'found the SpinFit CP145 , which is provided in FiiO FH7 '
                   'packaging and which fits me better than the original ear '
                   'tips. With the correct ear tips, the isolation is '
                   'moderate. I seldom use this commuting because the noise '
                   'from the surrounding environment leaks in. This is '
                   'distracting. However, fit and isolation is subjective. Ear '
                   'tip rolling can improve the isolation. I am still on my '
                   'way to find the best ear tips. There are three vents on '
                   'the inner side of the shell to mitigate driver flex. BQEYZ '
                   'is careful in designing the vent. It is good practice to '
                   'implement the vent on the inner side because this '
                   'minimizes the external noise once you are able to find a '
                   'good fit. Driver flex: when the driver bends under the '
                   'pressure of air against it. This usually occurs when '
                   'inserting the IEM into the ear. The air in the shell '
                   'creates pressure, which bends the driver. Pairing For this '
                   'review, I paired the Spring 1 with the Lotoo Paw 5000 mkii '
                   'digital audio player (DAP). I used SpinFit CP145 size L '
                   'ear tips for this review. I cannot comment on the '
                   'differences between BQEYZ’s provided ear tips because they '
                   'did not fit me well. Sound "Exuberant is the most '
                   'appropriate word to describe the sound signature of Spring '
                   '1." This is a relatively neutral IEM. When I first '
                   'listened to it, it reminded me of Empire Ears’s Empire '
                   'Studio Reference (ESR). There is a lot of energy in this '
                   'IEM from all the regions of the frequency spectrum. It is '
                   'fun but not fatiguing to listen to. The soundstage is deep '
                   'and wide. I would call it an oval shape stage because is '
                   'extends more in the Y-axis than it does in the X-axis. '
                   'Although the impedance is relatively high compared to '
                   'other IEMs on the market, it can be properly driven with '
                   'my Lotoo Paw 5000 mkii. It could be hard for a smartphone '
                   'to unleash Spring 1’s potential. So, I would encourage '
                   'users to use a dedicated amplifier or DAP to obtain the '
                   'best result. Lows The bass extension is decent. I do not '
                   'experience any sub-bass roll-off. A dynamic driver is used '
                   'here to produce the low frequency. Due to the response '
                   'speed of the 13mm dynamic driver, the bass decay is '
                   'slightly prolonged; this injects some warmth into the '
                   'overall sound signature. This is especially pronounced '
                   'when listening to jazz. I really like how saxophones in '
                   'jazz recordings sound on Spring 1 - warm with full body. '
                   'On the other hand, due to the slower response in the low '
                   'frequencies, there is some bleeding of the mid-bass into '
                   'the mids region. This slight bleeding could affect the '
                   'mids performance a little but the correct layering during '
                   'tuning minimizes the effect. BQEYZ has actually managed to '
                   'make the transition from lows to mids smooth. Mids A BA '
                   'driver covers the mid frequency region and the mids take '
                   'centre stage (no pun intended) during playback. I would '
                   'not call this a mid-centric IEM, but it does have a '
                   'slightly forward midrange. This could be a selling point '
                   'to those users who listen to pop songs like me. Male and '
                   'female vocals are handled well by Spring 1. When Olivia '
                   'Ong starts singing in Fly Me to the Moon (from the album A '
                   'Girl Meets Bossanova ), she owns the whole stage. Sweet, '
                   'airy, and spacious female vocals melt my heart '
                   'immediately. For male vocals, the energy from the lows '
                   'gives the overall sound a full and organic body. Andy Lau '
                   'sounds emotional and full of soul in When I Met You (from '
                   'the album Blue Heart) with Spring 1. Highs "Spring 1’s '
                   'secret weapon dominates the war of IEMs in the USD$200 '
                   'price range!" The Spring 1 uses a piezoelectric driver for '
                   'the treble region. Soaring highs are a good adjective for '
                   'Spring 1’s performance in the high frequencies. It is '
                   'airy, spacious, and very well-extended. I call this the '
                   'secret weapon because within this price range, it is rare '
                   'to find an IEM with such amazing performance in the highs. '
                   'The air in the highs improves the overall fidelity of '
                   'Spring 1. The sparkling highs also balance the warmth of '
                   'the lows, making this IEM well-balanced overall. "Are the '
                   'soaring highs bright or fatiguing? Well, although I have a '
                   'good tolerance for high frequencies, I find the highs in '
                   'Spring 1 to be as comfortable as a gentle tickle on my ear '
                   'drums." Comparisons BQEYZ Spring 1 vs NiceHCK NX7 This is '
                   'an attractive comparison and was a frequent request by '
                   'netizens in the comments on my unboxing post. A quick '
                   'introduction, NiceHCK NX7 is a triple hybrid IEM with 7 '
                   'drivers: 2 dynamic drivers, 4 BA, and a single '
                   'piezoelectric driver. I have always been more of a '
                   'believer in Campfire Audio’s ideology: less is more. '
                   'Driver count does not always tell us which is better. NX7 '
                   'is a cold and dark sounding IEM. The lows response is '
                   'touch and go. The extension in Spring 1 is much broader '
                   'than NX7. This makes Spring 1 more enjoyable to listen to. '
                   'Soundstage wise both of them are equally wide, but Spring '
                   '1 is deeper due to the bass extension. Personally, I would '
                   'vote for Spring 1 without any doubts. BQEYZ Spring 1 vs '

                   'philosophy is "the result of the persistent search for '
                   'pure sound quality. Every BGVP job not only seeks to '
                   'satisfy the audience, but also wants to find the trust, '
                   'pleasure and taste of the listener. They have several '
                   'models behind them, such as the earbud DX3, the IEMs '
                   '1DD+2BA DS1, the 2DD+2BA SDM5, the famous 5BA DM5, the 6BA '
                   'DM7, the 12BA ArtMagic V12...On this occasion I will '
                   'analyze the new model 1DD+2BA, called ArtMagic DH3. This '
                   'model has many peculiarities, it has been printed on the '
                   '3D printing equipment of German Envision TEC and is made '
                   'of PMMA acrylic fiber material that does not damage the '
                   'skin, also improves the resistance to high temperatures '
                   'and impacts. Its drivers are the combination of an 8mm '
                   'dynamic driver, a BA of Knowles, model ED-26989, for the '
                   'mid frequencies and BA, also of Knowles, called RAF-33518, '
                   'for the high frequencies. Another particularity is the use '
                   'of 2 small switches that allow to modify the sound, with 4 '
                   'different types of tuning, to enhance each range of '
                   'frequencies, in order to satisfy a wide audience. It also '
                   'has a 4-way electronic crossover, to efficiently '
                   'distribute all frequency ranges, mixing them as coherently '
                   'as possible, to create a frequency response capable of '
                   'being used for long periods of listening. Finally, the '
                   'cable is composed of 8 high purity "5N single crystal" '
                   'copper cores, which avoids having to be replaced by '
                   'another cable, since the quality is so high that changing '
                   'it would be very expensive and unnecessary. Specifications '

                   "has been built on German Envision TEC's 3D printing "
                   'equipment and is made of translucent PMMA acrylic fiber '
                   'material, which does not damage the skin. In addition, it '
                   'improves resistance to high temperatures and impacts. On '
                   'the outside you can see the brand logo. The MMCX '
                   'connection is embedded, gold-plated. Close to it, there is '
                   'an orifice covered by a metal tube. The drivers, cables '
                   'and connections can be seen inside the capsules. The '
                   'capsules are built in one piece and the nozzles are custom '
                   'type, with two holes and without any grids. On the inside '
                   'of the capsules you can read the name of the model and '
                   'some numbers. In my case, it puts 082R in the right '
                   'capsule and 082L in the left capsule. The drivers used '
                   'have been a dynamic driver of 8mm, for the low '
                   'frequencies, of biological diaphragm. For the mids, has '
                   'been implemented the BA of Knowles, ED-26989. Finally, for '
                   'the high frequencies, another Knowles BA is in charge, '
                   'model RAF-33518. All drivers are connected to improve the '
                   'resolution and provide a different sound. As a great '
                   'differentiating element, the DH3, have small switches, two '
                   'per capsule, which allow to modify the sound, generating 4 '
                   'different tunings. Thus, it is possible to emphasize the '
                   'lower zone, the midrange or the treble, in order to adjust '
                   'as best as possible to the taste of each one.It also has a '
                   '4-way electronic crossover, which provides very coherent '
                   'and accurate transitions. The MMCX connector is of high '
                   'quality, to avoid possible disconnections during use. The '
                   'cable consists of 8 high purity "5N single crystal" copper '
                   'cores. It is thick, but very suitable and manageable. It '
                   'has a semi-rigid coating to fit over the ear. Its color is '
                   'copper, covered with transparent plastic. The MMCX '
                   'connectors are covered by black and large cylinders, which '
                   'use red and blue rings as a channel mark. The splitting '
                   'piece is another smooth black cylinder with a soft barrel '
                   'shape. There is a small coin-shaped piece, made of '
                   'translucent white plastic, which serves as an adjustment '
                   'pin. The 3.5mm Jack connector cover is another large, '
                   'black, smooth metal cylinder. The cable has a Velcro strip '
                   'for safe retrieval. Great construction, great shape, great '
                   'cable and great finishes, at the height of its '
                   'presentation. Adjustment and Ergonomics The fit is good '
                   'and so is the comfort. But the mouthpieces are rather '
                   'short for those of us who, like me, have a big, deep ear '
                   'hole. But this allows the use of tri-flange tips. Rubber '
                   'washers can also be used as a buffer, making the simple '
                   'tips a little more separate from the body of the capsules. '
                   'In this way, a somewhat deeper insertion can be achieved. '
                   'Once this is corrected, the fit is firm and durable. The '
                   'cables are barely felt over the ear, offering good comfort '
                   'even when walking down the street. The insulation will '
                   'depend on the degree of sealing we get, with the tips '
                   'used. But if you get them right, the soundproofing '
                   'achieved is remarkable. Sound Profile The profile of the '
                   'DH3 may vary depending on the position of the switches. A '
                   'very, very balanced, flat profile up to 5kHz can be '
                   'achieved. Or vary to a warmer profile, slightly V. All '
                   'this without losing details and the fantastic midrange '
                   'they possess. Switch Positions 1 OFF - 2 OFF. In short '
                   'mode 00: mids enhancement. 1 ON - 2 OFF. In abbreviated '
                   'mode 10: Highlighting of mids and highs. 1 ON - 2 ON. In '
                   'abbreviated mode 11: Bass and mids enhancement. 1 OFF - 2 '
                   'ON. In abbreviated mode 01: Bass enhancement. Bass With '
                   'the switches in position 01, maximum bass boost is '
                   'achieved. It is very similar, also in position 11, but for '
                   'this case, there is an emphasis on voices, which is not '
                   'shown in the frequency response, but is audible. The lower '
                   'zone, in these positions, takes more prominence, but '
                   'without dominating the profile. The DH3 become warmer '
                   'IEMS, but without losing the presence in the voices it '
                   'possesses. In this way, the profile is animated, leaving a '
                   'more powerful bass medium, with a deeper and more '
                   'notorious sub-bass, but quite contained and without '
                   'arriving, with complete emphasis, in the lower zone. The '
                   'hit is never too powerful and the bassheads would be '
                   'somewhat disappointed with them. When the switches are '
                   'placed in position 00 or 10, the timbre or the texture of '
                   'the lower zone do not change, it only seems that the voice '
                   'is released from that lower zone heavier, becoming a more '
                   'agile IEM, but without losing the trace of the bass. In '
                   'reality, the decrease in presence in this area is clear, '
                   'but it is not a cut, but rather a matter of obtaining '
                   'balance. And if it is achieved. In fact, it is a great '
                   'signal, because you can enjoy, quietly, all the color and '
                   'nuance of the bass, in all positions. The bass always '
                   'feels fast and clean, with hardly any posus or negative '
                   'trace. Although it is true the influence on the voices of '
                   'the greatest warmth, in the positions of greatest presence '
                   'of bass. Mids The midrange of the DH3 is simply exemplary. '
                   'No matter how you position the switches, you can always '
                   'enjoy this range without reservations. Although it is '
                   'clear that in positions 00 and 10, the clarity of the mids '
                   'is maximum. For mid-range, I prefer positions 00 and 11. '
                   'But my maximum enjoyment of this range is with position '
                   '00. The first thing that calls the attention of the middle '
                   'zone of the DH3 is the execution, it is really precise, '
                   'but also relaxed. In addition, the environment in which it '
                   'develops, overflows absolute clarity and cleanliness. '
                   'Again, the light is very important in the result of the '
                   'sound of these IEMs. The DH3 are placed in that limbo of '
                   'luminous headphones, which bring so much joy to the '
                   'midrange. As I say, the definition deserves a separate '
                   'mention, especially in the voices. They are placed in the '
                   'position of the scene, where they are protagonists, in the '
                   'highest and closest, as if it were a diva. You only have '
                   'to look up and contemplate how they flow and stand out '
                   'from the rest of the instrumentation. The level of '
                   'resolution is very high, as is expected of a BA. But, on '
                   'this occasion, the driver has been sweetened so that it '
                   "doesn't sound too analytical, but light and precise, "
                   'halfway to naturalness, but impressively resolute. This '
                   'can be seen in the separation that the voices have from '
                   'the rest of the instruments. They are not left behind, but '
                   'by their side, respecting the space, recreating a very '
                   'immersive sensation: it is easy to dive among them, while '
                   'the voices are perceived. In general, balance and '
                   'equilibrium are great. On this occasion we perceive a '
                   'slightly more digital look, but without being unreal, that '
                   'analytical touch that shapes the sound. The great news is '
                   'that with the switches, you can gain in warmth, filing a '
                   'bit the defined profile of the middle zone. The midrange '
                   'of the DH3 is so good that it deserves a totally attentive '
                   'listening to be able to enjoy them without reservations. '
                   'Treble The highs are contained, as soon as they start they '
                   'drop in gain. Then they increase but without assuming '
                   'imbalance, nor an annoying emphasis. Thus, the upper zone '
                   'feels sweet and this hardly changes with the switches. '
                   'However, it is clear that in the unenhanced positions of '
                   'the lower zone, the highs sound freer and more '
                   'perceptible. In spite of this, the high details are felt '
                   'with clarity and a lot of definition, but with that soft '
                   "nuance, so characteristic in the headphones that I've been "
                   'analyzing lately. At the higher end, there is a slight '
                   'shortness of air. All in all, the DH3 offers a more '
                   'musical, pleasant and restrained sound than other IEMS '
                   'with BA drivers, but without falling into a dark, just '
                   'warm sound. Soundstage, Separation The scene is '
                   'characterized by the high resolution offered by DH3. And '
                   "it's almost bigger when it's tuned with less bass, as the "
                   'mids shine brighter. The proximity of the voices and their '
                   'relation with the rest of the instruments, the space that '
                   'exists, the good separation, the excellent location that '
                   'is generated... causes a reconstruction of the image from '
                   'the vocalists, where the whole scene expands from their '
                   'point of view. In instrumental or electronic music, the '
                   'image floats, equally defined, where the rest of the '
                   'elements take the leading role to widen the scene. The '
                   'proximity of the mids provides depth, because many sound '
                   'planes are established. The bass and treble extend the '
                   'image towards the sides. The details are precise and '
                   'placed in such a way that they impress for the price '
                   'level. There is so much air and space between elements '
                   'that listening becomes a rediscovery that almost forces '
                   'the listener to remain very attentive so as not to lose a '
                   'single nuance. Comparisons Moondrop Kanas Pro The first '
                   'comparison will be with one of my favorite IEMS: the Kanas '
                   'Pro. The DH3, without bass enhancement, have a similar '
                   'level in the lower part, although the Kanas Pro are one '
                   'point above, offering a beautiful depth and very tight '
                   'bass. The DH3, with bass enhancement, surpass them clearly '
                   'in the presence of bass. In addition, the BGVP are more '
                   'balanced and have more presence in the middle and first '
                   'highs, offering more extension in the upper zone. The '
                   'sound of the Kanas Pro, seems more concrete than that of '
                   'the DH3. It is something that is noticed in the mids, more '
                   'focused in the Pro. While in the DH3, they have this '
                   'tendency to expand and sound more ethereal. The timbre is '
                   'different, it could be said that they are conditioned by '
                   'their origin: the DH3 deliver more brightness and a '
                   'greater sense of projection, but also less concretion. The '
                   'Kanas have very compact mids, with a smaller projection, '
                   'but with a better definition, a little more body and a '
                   'less cold timbre. But the DH3 has a wonderful option, '
                   'which allows you to tune the sound. If the basses are '
                   "enhanced, the voices gain in warmth and body, and that's "
                   "where the Kanas Pro can't compete against that "
                   'versatility. At the level of separation and scene, I place '
                   'the DH3 above. There is a clear greater separation and a '
                   'more expansive scene. I also distinguish more details and '
                   "nuances in the DH3. But it's still a titan duel. DB Monroe "
                   'One of the IEMS that have surprised me lately, have been '
                   'the DB Monroe. They have a powerful lower part and some '
                   'balance in the middle zone, although their profile is '
                   'slightly U-shaped. The first thing to note is that the DH3 '
                   'are much more sensitive and give a much higher volume, at '
                   'the same level as the Monroe. Starting from the lower '
                   'zone, in the Monroe, its presence polarizes all the sound, '
                   'since it revolves around the lows. They are full of energy '
                   "and that's noticeable, it's a very big sound in this part, "
                   'not suitable for all audiences. The DH3, with bass '
                   'enhancement, do not get to have as much energy as the '
                   'Monroe. Besides, their sub bass is not as deep. Although '
                   'both have a similar color, the DH3 have greater speed and '
                   'their hit is more contained and exerts less pressure on '
                   'the ears. But, I insist, there are similarities in texture '
                   'and timbre, despite the difference in energy delivered. '
                   "The middle zone is more different. Monroe don't have mids "
                   'as close up as DH3 (no matter how the switches are). They '
                   'stay behind the bass area of the DBs. While in DH3, they '
                   'always glow. In this range there is a difference of timbre '
                   'and color, especially in the voices. The Monroe have more '
                   'warmth, smoothness, some darkness and the DH3 bring more '
                   'light and clarity, you notice more resolution and '
                   'definition. Although, comparatively speaking, there seems '
                   'to be a certain hollowness in the voices of the DH3, '
                   'because they have less body and warmth, but it is only '
                   'their cooler tendency, finer, more defined and higher '
                   'resolution. Absolutely, one notices the special treatment '
                   'that the mids have in the DH3, where they are the axis of '
                   'their sound. In the upper zone, both begin with the same '
                   'tendency, to decay at the beginning of the range. But, '
                   'however, later on, the DH3 fill the treble extension more '
                   'markedly, reaching more detail and a brighter complexion. '
                   'The trebles in Monroe are finer and sharper. In the DH3 '
                   'they have a greater projection, extending more, sounding '
                   'with more width and harmonics. This makes them even have a '
                   'little more softness, but actually gives the sound a '
                   'greater amount of air, a virtue that the Monroe do not '
                   'have. If we talk about scene and separation, the DH3 are '
                   'placed above. The amplitude of their sound is determined '
                   'by greater separation, more air, a higher resolution level '
                   'and more detailed definition. The expansion in the '
                   'midzone, which the DH3 have, dwarfs the more focused '
                   'scenario offered by the DB Monroe. Their greater '
                   'forcefulness in the lower zone cages a sound, which could '
                   'develop more; but not only they are guilty, but their '
                   'upper zone also penalizes in this sense. Finally, the '
                   'possibilities of tuning that the DH3 possess, favor him in '
                   'a direct confrontation, at sonorous level. In terms of '
                   'construction, both are very different. Monroe are '
                   'metallic, heavier, but smaller. DH3s are printed with '
                   'acrylic fiber, but they are bigger and thicker. This can '
                   'penalize their adjustment. The quality of the cable is '
                   'better than the one that comes with the Monroe. Both '
                   'packages are very good, but, in the case of Monroe, it has '
                   'a special and particular touch, which makes it very '
                   'difficult to beat. Conclusion I have to say, BGVP ArtMagic '
                   "DH3 has become another of my favorite IEMS. And it's not "
                   'their lower zone that convinced me, without it being a '
                   'reproach. It was their mids and the versatility of the '
                   'switches to tune the sound to our liking. The great scene, '
                   'the remarkable separation and the excellent location of '
                   'every detail, are other great virtues of these DH3. But it '
                   "doesn't end there, because to all that has been said, we "
                   'must add the level of construction, the cable, the '
                   'packaging, the accessories and the transport box. The BGVP '
                   'ArtMagic DH3 is a wise choice for those who cannot buy '
                   'several IEMS with different profiles, because they are '
                   'capable of transforming themselves from a balanced sound '

                   'manufacturers of in ear monitors (IEMs) in the industry. '
                   "If you're not very familiar with them, they have a rich "
                   'history which consists of many firsts. In 1990, they '
                   'produced the first custom-fit IEM with a balanced armature '
                   'driver. In 1996, working with Jerry Harvey, they produced '
                   'the first dual-driver balanced armature custom IEM. They '
                   'have been making universal-fit IEMs for decades as well. '
                   'They claim to be the largest manufacturer of custom-fit '
                   'earpieces in the world, which is probably true, '
                   'considering they make earpieces for hearing protection and '
                   'the military in addition to just IEMs for musicians and '
                   'audiophiles. They are headquartered in Colorado. You can '

                   'five-driver balanced armature IEM. Westone designed the '
                   'B50 for "the music lover who just can’t get enough '
                   'low-end. By combining our largest low-end '
                   'balanced-armature driver, with two mid-range, and two '
                   'high-frequency drivers the B50 creates a sound that is '
                   'totally immersive, with sonic detail and clarity that has '
                   'to be heard to be believed." The B50 is the more expensive '
                   'sibling of the three-driver B30 ($449.99) . Together, '
                   "these two IEMs form Westone's new B series, which is "
                   'specifically tuned for those who enjoy a low end that is '
                   'far above neutral. The B series is an offshoot of '
                   "Westone's regular audiophile lineup, the W series . More "
                   'specifically, the B50 and B30 are each a new version of '
                   'the older W50 and W30, respectively, which appear to have '
                   'been discontinued. Westone told me that while the basic '

                   'sources, but believe that IEMs should be able to be driven '
                   'well from a smartphone, as they are designed for on-the-go '
                   'use. While the B50 might sound slightly better with more '
                   'expensive equipment, I believe that at its price point '
                   'most customers will be using it with just a smartphone. As '
                   'such, they are relatively easy to drive at 35Ω, and I had '
                   'no issues using them with my iPhone. With both included '
                   'cables I usually had my iPhone set to just under halfway '
                   'for volume. As I previously mentioned, the B50 is five '
                   'balanced armature driver design with a three-way passive '
                   'crossover. Westone specifies the frequency response as 10 '
                   'Hz – 20 kHz, the sensitivity as 118 dB SPL at 1 mW and '
                   'passive noise attenuation (isolation) at 25 dB. Rounding '
                   'out the specs is a 24-month warranty, which is normal at '
                   "this price point. You can read Westone's spec sheet for "
                   'the B50 here . The best place to buy the B50, or any other '
                   "Westone IEM, is probably from Westone's own website. The "
                   'links above will take you to it. Design and Accessories – '
                   '19/20 The packaging of the B50 is elegant and nice enough '
                   'to be presented as a gift without going overboard. The '
                   'front of the large box has an enlarged picture of the B50, '
                   'with an equalizer band below it. Five of the equalizer '
                   'bands are colored orange to represent the five drivers in '
                   'each B50 earpiece. The other sides of the box have '
                   'information about Westone and the B50 itself. The top 90% '
                   'of the box comes off, revealing a pull flap. Under this is '
                   'the B50 along with the carrying case, which contains all '
                   'the other included accessories. The design of the B50 is a '
                   'bit bland, but very functional. The oval-shaped earpieces '
                   'themselves are made of a hard plastic with nozzles that '
                   'are a bit narrower than most other IEMs I have used. The '
                   'nozzles have a six-character serial number printed onto '
                   'them. A metal face plate sits on the end of the earpiece '
                   'opposite the nozzle. These faceplates can be swapped out '
                   'using an included tiny screwdriver; black comes '
                   'preinstalled but orange ones are also included. The '
                   'faceplates wrap around the earpiece, with an R or L on the '
                   'inside to indicate the channel and bold B50 text on the '
                   'outside. I initially swapped out the black for the orange '
                   'on only the right side, to make it easier to distinguish '
                   'the two channels when putting the earphones in my ears. '
                   'But I soon found the large letter on the faceplate to be '
                   'more than sufficient to tell them apart, so I switched the '
                   'left earpiece over to the orange as well. While the B50 '
                   "isn't going to win any fashion contests, I found the "
                   'orange faceplates to be more stylish and vibrant. The last '
                   'notable feature on the housings are the MMCX connectors '
                   'that allow for the cable to be changed, either between the '
                   'included 3.5mm or Bluetooth cables or a third-party '
                   "option. Westone told me that the B50's MMCX connectors are "
                   'durable enough to support frequent replacement of the '
                   'cable, say if you wanted to switch back and forth between '
                   'Bluetooth or 3.5mm several times a week for different '
                   'uses. MMCX and two-pin connectors are the two most popular '
                   'connectors for IEM cables. Personally, I prefer two-pin, '
                   'as the earpiece can rotate around on the MMCX pin, which '
                   'can make it harder to tell which channel is which when '
                   'taking them out of the case. But that is a minor issue. As '
                   'previously mentioned, the B50 includes both a 3.5mm cable '
                   "and a Bluetooth cable. The 3.5mm cable is Westone's "
                   'High-Definition Silver MMCX Audio Cable ($124.99) . This '
                   'is a premium cable and is a step above the regular cable '
                   'included with lesser earphones. According to Westone, this '
                   'cable "features four multi-strands of ultra-low resistance '
                   'pure silver-plated copper tensile wire which improves '
                   'electrical conductivity and is reinforced with a special '
                   'aramid-fiber strengthening core. This lightweight cable '
                   'also uses a smooth low-durometer outer sleeve that is '
                   'specially designed to keep cable noise to a bare minimum, '
                   'and remain soft and flexible even through the most rugged '
                   'use ... The smooth-jacketed, ultra-low resistance '
                   'High-Definition Silver Cable from Westone, improves '
                   'electrical conductivity, provides extraordinary detail and '
                   'clarity, with enhanced sound reproduction, making it the '
                   'perfect match for our entire line of universal-fit '
                   'earphones and custom-fit in-ear monitors." Each side of '
                   'the cable starts with the MMCX connector with a '
                   'translucent covering over it for strain relief. At the top '
                   'of the strain relief covering, over the connector, is a '
                   'thin colored ring to mark the channel; red for the right '
                   'and blue for the left. While important for connecting it '
                   'to the proper earpiece, I found the big lettering on the '
                   'earpiece faceplates to be much more practical for telling '
                   'the sides apart in day-to-day use. The strain reliefs give '
                   'way to transparent earguides that extend about two inches '
                   'down the cable. There is no memory wire under the '
                   'earguides, which is a shame, as I do find cables with '
                   'memory wires stay over the ear a bit better than those '
                   'without. I am taking off half a point for this lack of '
                   'memory wire, as the cable infrequently had to be adjusted '
                   'to stay over my ear when I was walking or moving my head a '
                   "lot. This wasn't a major issue, but is something that "
                   "shouldn't happen to begin with. After the earguides, each "
                   'channel has a thin braided strand of two wires that meet '
                   'at the translucent two-piece cable splitter after about a '
                   'foot. There is no in-line remote control and microphone, '
                   'which I think is acceptable since this is a premium cable '
                   'designed for the best sound quality possible, and the '
                   'included Bluetooth cable does include a remote and '
                   'microphone. The cable splitter is sturdy and features a '
                   'clear W Westone logo on it. I found the cinch of the '
                   'splitter to work well for helping the B50 stay put and '
                   'minimize cable noise. After the splitter, the two channel '
                   "cables aren't joined together, but rather continue in "
                   'separate but connected plastic coverings until they reach '
                   'the translucent 3.5mm connector. The connector is at a '
                   'right angle and is very sturdy. Unfortunately, the '
                   'right-angle connectors are very awkward to use with '
                   'headphone adapter dongles on newer smartphones, so I am '
                   'taking half a point off for this. This is either going to '
                   'be a nonissue or big deal depending on your source device. '
                   'Personally, I am not a big believer in expensive cable '
                   'upgrades like some on head-fi are. But this cable features '
                   'a nice combination of durability, high-end cabling and '
                   'stylish design that should prevent all but the most '
                   'hardcore cable enthusiasts from having to upgrade it. '
                   'While I think the asking price of $124.99 when purchased '
                   'separately is a bit steep, this is definitely a nice cable '
                   "and it's great to see it included with the B50 over "
                   "Westone's cheaper and more basic cables. The B50 also "
                   "comes with Westone's original Bluetooth Cable ($99.99) "
                   'that was released in 2016. I say original, because has '
                   'since came out with a Bluetooth V2 Cable ($149.99) . There '
                   'are a few differences between the two. The included '
                   'original cable uses the older Bluetooth 4.0 standard with '
                   'the CSR8645 chipset, supports aptX, has 8 hours of battery '
                   'life and is IPX4 rated for sweat resistance. The V2 cable '
                   'upgrades these specs to Bluetooth 5.0 with the CSR8675 '
                   'chipset, supports aptX HD 8 hours of battery life with a '
                   'removable battery pack that provides an additional four '
                   'hours in between charges and is IPX5 rated for sweat and '
                   'water resistance. Both versions of the Bluetooth cable '
                   'feature a three-button remote and microphone. '
                   'Additionally, both cables support the AAC codec in '
                   'addition to their respective versions of aptX. This is '
                   "important for iPhone owners since Apple still doesn't "
                   'support aptX. The included cable lacks the voice announcer '
                   'found in most modern Bluetooth audio products. Usually, '
                   'this announces the device name, battery level, codec being '
                   'used and volume level, and I missed having it. But this '
                   'feature was not nearly as common in 2016 when this cable '
                   "was released. The Bluetooth's cable's controls are a bit "
                   'different than most three-button remotes, but I quickly '
                   'got used to them. Instead of double and triple pressing '
                   'the middle button to switch tracks, you hold down the '
                   'volume up and down buttons for a second. Siri is activated '
                   'by double pressing the middle button instead of holding it '
                   'down. The cable recharges via micro USB, and a short cable '
                   'is included. I did not use the Bluetooth cable enough to '
                   'have to recharge it, but I have no reason to doubt '
                   "Westone's claimed battery life. The cable's battery "
                   'percentage shows up in iOS, and I received the cable at '
                   '60%. After using it for a few hours it was at 40%. You can '
                   'read more about the included Bluetooth cable in the spec '
                   'sheet and quick start guide . Each side of the Bluetooth '
                   'cable has a black covering over the MMCX connector for '
                   'strain relief. There are no colored rings for channel '
                   'identification here like in the 3.5mm cable, rather each '
                   'side has a L or R embedded into the strain relief '
                   'covering. It is definitely not the most visible way to '
                   'identify each side, but it works fine for the switching '
                   'out the cable. Any other time you can just rely on the '
                   'faceplate markings. The cable has no earguides or memory '
                   'wire in the ears. About four inches down on each side is a '
                   'battery (left side) or remote and microphone (right side). '
                   'These are each about an inch and a half long. The cable '
                   'then has a cinch that controls any excess length, which I '
                   'found there to be plenty of. There are two ways to wear '
                   'the cable: with the excess cable channeled in front of the '
                   'body or in back. I found wearing it in back to be more '
                   'comfortable and have a more secure fit, but the mic is '
                   'basically unusable in this position since it is behind the '
                   'neck. When I made calls in this position the caller had '
                   'trouble hearing me. On the other hand, when I wore it in '
                   'front, it was slightly less comfortable but callers said I '
                   'sounded crystal clear. I am not taking off any points for '
                   'this because it is an issue many similar Bluetooth '
                   'products have and when worn in front of the body the '
                   'microphone sounds great. In terms of sound quality, I '
                   'found the Bluetooth cable to be excellent. I was '
                   'pleasantly surprised considering it uses Bluetooth 4.0, '
                   'which dates back to 2010. Some may find it to be a bit '
                   'less detailed than the 3.5mm cable, but I am hesitant to '
                   'criticize it for this because I was only able to use the '
                   'AAC codec, and not the higher-resolution aptX. Regardless, '
                   'even with AAC I found the cable to sound at least 80-90% '
                   'as good as the 3.5mm cable. If your source supports aptX '
                   "it'll sound even better. The connection strength is very "
                   'good. Very occasionally, perhaps a few times every half '
                   'hour, the sound cut out for less than a second. So, the '
                   "connection isn't perfect, but it's more than usable. Just "
                   'like with the included 3.5mm cable, I think the asking '
                   'price of the Bluetooth cable when purchased separately is '
                   'a bit steep, given that it uses a dated version of '
                   'Bluetooth and lacks a voice announcer. But there are very '
                   'few other companies that I am aware of that include both a '
                   '3.5mm and Bluetooth cable in the box (Audeze comes to mind '
                   'with its latest LCD-i3). Therefore, I am very happy to see '
                   'this cable included in the box with the B50. It will '
                   'definitely be good enough for some customers, but if your '
                   'device supports aptX HD or you plan on using the B50 '
                   'exclusively with Bluetooth I would consider upgrading to '
                   'the V2 cable. The B50 includes ten pairs of tips: five are '
                   'silicon (Westone calls these Star Fit) and five are foam '
                   '(Westone calls these True-Fit). Each size tip comes in '
                   'both silicon and foam. There are two thicknesses of '
                   'shorter tips and three thicknesses of longer tips. Westone '
                   "colors the part of each tip that goes over the earpiece's "
                   'nozzle according to its length and thickness. For example, '
                   'the thickest longer tip is colored orange. The colors are '
                   "the same for each size's foam and silicon tips. This is a "
                   'great idea and should make reordering tips a lot easier, '
                   'as you just need to look for the color of the tips you '
                   'like instead of remembering what size they are. Westone '
                   'claims to have invested significant resources in '
                   'developing their tips and it shows. They are definitely '
                   "high quality. I would've liked to have seen some "
                   'double-flanged silicon tips as well, as I have liked those '
                   'on other IEMs I have tried, but I am not taking off any '
                   'points for this since the B50 includes as many, if not '
                   'more, tips than most other IEMs. The last included '
                   'accessory is the nylon hardshell case. It has a metal '
                   'Westone logo on the bottom right of the top and a sturdy '
                   'zipper around the middle. This is a pretty big case, and '
                   'it can hold the B50 and all included accessories. If you '
                   'use a separate audio player other than your phone, it '
                   'might fit in the case if you take out some of the '
                   'accessories. My iPhone 6 was just a bit too tall to fit, '
                   'and most newer smartphones are even bigger. The inside of '
                   'the case is lined with a luxurious feeling velvety '
                   'material. There is a divider on one side of the case along '
                   'with a mesh covering to hold any smaller accessories. '
                   'Overall, this is a nice case and should do a great job of '
                   'protecting the B50. Unfortunately, it is too big to be '
                   'pocketable. I usually just put it in my messenger bag in '
                   "the morning, but this didn't work if I left without taking "
                   'the messenger bag. I will probably complement the included '
                   'case with a smaller one for when I just want to take the '
                   'B50 and need it to fit in my pocket. If this section has '
                   "seemed lengthy it's because the B50 includes more useful "
                   'and valuable accessories than most other IEMs. The '
                   "accessory package is so great that most customers won't "
                   'need to consider cable or tip upgrades. Therefore, I am '
                   'increasing the weight of this category from ten points to '
                   'twenty. Since I took off half a point each for the lack of '
                   'memory wire and use of a right-angle connector in the '
                   '3.5mm cable, the B50 gets nineteen points. Overall, I am '
                   "very pleased with the B50's included accessories and feel "
                   'that they are competitive, if not a step above, the '
                   'competition. Comfort, Fit and Isolation – 9.5/10 I have '
                   'grouped these three together because I believe that for '
                   'IEMs they are all intimately related. If you don’t get a '
                   'good fit, the earphones are likely to be uncomfortable and '
                   'not isolate well. As discussed previously, the B50 comes '
                   'with five pairs of silicon tips and five pairs of foam '
                   'tips. It is vitally important that anyone using an IEM try '
                   'out all the different included tips to see which works '
                   "best for them. If the tip isn't sealing well you are going "
                   'to get weak bass and poor noise isolation. I liked how '
                   'Westone varies the length of the tip as well as the '
                   'thickness. This should allow most people to get a good fit '
                   'with one of the included tips. The tip material can affect '
                   'the sound and I found the silicon tips allowed the B50 to '
                   "sound slightly more detailed, although it wasn't a huge "
                   'difference. I also found the silicon tips to be more '
                   "comfortable, particularly the short pair, since it doesn't "
                   'go as deep into the ear. This was the pair of tips I '
                   'preferred while at home. Using the longer silicon tips '
                   'made me experience discomfort after about a half hour or '
                   'so. But foam tips are much better at blocking noise than '
                   'silicon tips, although they do have the disadvantage of '
                   'needing to be replaced more often as they get dirty and '
                   'lose their shape. Westone rates the B50 for 25 dB of noise '
                   'isolation, which they confirmed was with the included foam '
                   'tips. I was a bit surprised by this, as it is very close '
                   'to the 26 dB of noise isolation most custom IEMs are rated '
                   'for. But I can confirm that the B50 has an above average '
                   'amount of noise isolation when used with the longer foam '
                   'tips. I used these while commuting in a noisy city and on '
                   'a screeching subway and it did a great job blocking out '
                   'the noise. It was almost as good as a custom IEM, but not '
                   'quite there. That being said, I think the B50 with its '
                   'foam tips will be better than most other universal IEMs in '
                   'terms of noise isolation. When using these long foam tips, '
                   'I was able to wear them for about 30-45 minutes before '
                   'experiencing any discomfort, which was enough for what I '
                   'needed. But if I wanted to better balance comfort and '
                   "noise isolation, I would've tried the shorter foam tips. "
                   'When I said the design of the B50 was a bit bland, I also '
                   'said it was very functional. And fit is an area where this '
                   'comes into play. The earpiece shapes fit very well in the '
                   'ear and when I used the shorter silicon tips I could wear '
                   'them for hours at a time without any discomfort. '
                   "Additionally, I didn't find cable noise to be an issue "
                   "with either of the B50's included cables. This means that "
                   "when you walk or move around with them you won't notice "
                   'the sound of the cable running against your shirt. In '
                   'summary, I found the many included high-quality tips '
                   'combined with the ergonomic shape of the earpieces made '
                   'for a very comfortable fit and great noise isolation when '
                   'needed. Soundstage – 9.25/10 The soundstage is excellent '
                   'for an IEM. When listening to more complicated tracks the '
                   'imaging does a great job separating the different '
                   'instruments and vocals. Vocals in particular are close and '
                   'up front which makes the music more intimate. I listened '
                   'to some recordings on YouTube that vary the position of '
                   'the recording and I was able to easily track it moving '
                   'with the B50. That being said, I wouldn’t go so far to say '
                   'that the soundstage compares to an open headphone or an '
                   'open IEM such as Audeze’s iSINE series, but it does a '
                   'great job overall and I have no complaints. The amount of '
                   'detail and separation is going to depend on the quality of '
                   'your recordings. I found the B50 to be a bit less '
                   'forgiving than other IEMs but it really shines with high '
                   'quality recordings. Highs (Treble) – 9.25/10 The highs on '
                   'the B50 are better than I expected given the bass-heavy '
                   'tuning. Strings, piano notes and cymbals are all very '
                   'clear, with perhaps just the slightest hint of muddying '
                   'from the emphasized low end. On most songs I felt like the '
                   'highs sort of got out of the way. They provide sufficient '
                   'clarity and detail to let the low end shine. Mids – 8.5/10 '
                   'I have mixed feelings on the mids of the B50, and to me '
                   'they were definitely the weakest part of its sound. On '
                   'recordings with a significant low end there is a fair '
                   'amount of bleeding from the lows into the mids that '
                   'muddies the sound. I found this to be less of an issue on '
                   'higher quality recordings, and even less so on acoustic '
                   'recordings with less low end. On some recordings the mids '
                   'were good, with clear vocals and percussion that took '
                   'nothing away from my enjoyment of the music. Some purely '
                   'acoustic recordings even sounded great. But on some lesser '
                   'recordings vocals could be a bit muddy and piercing, and '
                   'drum hits a bit shallow and thin, lacking depth. This is '
                   "by no means to say that the mids are bad, as they aren't. "
                   'Someone hearing an IEM in this price range for the first '
                   "time will likely be amazed by the B50's. But this is an "
                   "area where the B50 didn't wow me. Lows (Bass) – 9.75/10 "
                   "Simply put, if you're a basshead, you will love the B50's "
                   'bass. I certainly do. It goes deep, with sub-bass being '
                   'well represented. The bass as a whole is emphasized, but '
                   'not out of control. Keep in mind that I prefer enhanced '
                   "bass, so it's entirely possible someone else might "
                   'disagree with me about it not being out of control. I '
                   'found the attack to be great, almost like a dynamic '
                   "driver. It has a bit of boom and rumble, but I wouldn't go "
                   "so far to say it's like a subwoofer, but it's getting "
                   'there. It hits far harder than most balanced armature IEMs '
                   'do. The accuracy is good in the sense that different bass '
                   'frequencies can be distinguished, but B50 unashamedly '
                   "doesn't claim to represent the recording as the artist "
                   'intended, with its emphasized bass. If I had to nitpick, '
                   "I'd say the decay is a bit faster than I would have liked. "
                   'Value – 9/10 I think the B50 is a fair value at its '
                   'current price, given its sound quality and extensive '
                   'accessory package. The sound combines the best sound '
                   'characteristics of a balanced armature design with '
                   "emphasized bass. And if that's what you're looking for I "
                   'think the B50 is competitive at its price point, and might '
                   "even be able to be an end-game IEM, if you don't want to "
                   'spend a lot more money in the future. The beauty of the '
                   'accessory package is that most customers will find it '
                   "adequate and won't have to spent another cent on the B50. "
                   'In the box you get a premium cable to use it wired, and an '
                   'adequate (although not state of the art) Bluetooth cable '
                   'in case you want to go wireless. To top it off, the '
                   'hardshell case can safely hold everything that comes in '
                   'the box. That being said, I would be remiss to not point '
                   'out that the B50 costs $699.99. While this might not seem '
                   'like a lot in a market where some flagship IEMs are now '
                   'going for $3,000+, it is far from an impulse purchase. '
                   'Most consumers would consider $300 to be expensive for an '
                   'audio product, and the B50 is going to be out of reach for '
                   'these people. But I do think Westone priced the B50 '
                   "perfectly, given the market. Any higher, and I'd probably "
                   'recommend people look at a custom IEM. On the other hand, '
                   'if the price falls in the future the B50 could become a '
                   'much better value. Selected Comparison Jerry Harvey JH 11 '
                   'Pro ($999.99) – The JH 11 Pro is a four-driver '
                   'configuration with dual low, a single mid and a single '
                   'high driver. I am going to preface this comparison by '
                   "saying it's pretty unfair to the B50. My JH 11s are "
                   'customs, but the added cost of them being custom is '
                   "probably canceled out by the B50's much better accessory "
                   'package. The JH 11 comes with only one barebones cable, '
                   "which although adequate, isn't as nice as the B50's. There "
                   "is no Bluetooth cable included. So assuming the B50's "
                   'accessory package cancels out the extra cost of the JH 11s '
                   'being custom fit, there is a $300 price difference between '
                   "the two (and this doesn't include the cost of getting ear "
                   "impressions made), so the JH 11s cost 42% more. But I'm "
                   'going to compare them anyway, since the JH 11s are the '
                   'nicest IEMs I have, and I think they have a similar sound '
                   "signature to the B50. As you'd probably expect given the "
                   'price difference, I like the sound of the JH 11 more, as '
                   'it combines a similarly powerful bass response with better '
                   'clarity in the mids and highs. To put it more simply, '
                   'while the B50 sounds great to me on most songs, the JH 11 '
                   'sounds great on almost all songs, no matter the genre. So, '
                   "I'd say the JH 11 Pro builds on the few sonic flaws the "
                   'B50 has. The custom fit also makes it unfair to compare '
                   'the bass between the two, as a good custom fit will give '
                   'the best possible seal and bass response. The JH 11 also '
                   'has slightly better noise isolation than the B50, as it '
                   'perfectly fills a large part of the ear. Although I had no '
                   "complaints with the B50's comfort, the JH 11s are more "
                   'comfortable, as would be expected with something custom '
                   "designed for the user's ear. In summary, while I'd "
                   'definitely choose the custom JH 11s over the B50, the '
                   'large price difference makes it an unfair comparison. I '
                   "was impressed by the B50's ability to somewhat hold its "
                   'own against the JH 11. Conclusion – 9.28/10 I will start '
                   'this conclusion by saying that if you are looking for a '
                   'neutral sound signature, or an IEM to use for professional '
                   'music applications, stay far away from the B50. You will '
                   'hate its colored sound. That being said, I think Westone '
                   'did a great job with the B50. It really shined with '

                   'IEM with great bass. It was also able to hold its own on '
                   'many acoustic recordings. Although it is not perfect, I '
                   'only had a few criticisms and most were minor. It combines '
                   'an audiophile-quality sound (although tuned for '
